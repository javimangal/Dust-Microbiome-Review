# Description

A selection of studies included in the scoping review that had available raw sequence data and a comparable dust collection method were identified to retrieve sequence data to undergo processing in the same pipeline, as a proof of concept that pooled analyses could offer insight into the composition of the indoor dust microbiome and to identify potential needs and difficulties for the performance of such pooled microbiome analyses. The type of indoor environment was restricted to dwellings as this was the most common type of indoor environment. A total of **3 studies**[@fakunle2023a; @amin2022a; @vestergaard2018a] following the electrostatic dust collector (EDC) method and **2 studies**[@hickman2022a; @adams2020a] using the petri dish method were selected due to the known comparability of these sample collection methods.[@adams2015a] Additionally, previously unpublished data from a study sampling Dutch households with the EDC method was also included. Of these, 5 studies reported bacterial indoor dust sequences, whereas 4 reported the fungal microbiome.

This report includes the processing and analysis of **fungal ITS** sequences.

## Nigerian[@fakunle2023a] and Dutch (unpublished) households

Dutch and Nigerian indoor dust samples follow similar methods of collection through EDC and were processed and analyzed together in the laboratory. These samples have been sequenced for the 16S rRNA combined V5-V6 hypervariable region for bacteria, and the ITS1 region between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA subunits for fungi. After processing, these were compared against the SILVA (bacteria) and UNITE datasets to determine the microbial composition of the samples.

The Dutch samples are from a cross-sectional study aiming to assess environmental factors as determinants of the indoor house dust microbial composition. The study population consisted of households located in Utrecht and surrounding areas of whose inhabitants were invited between April and May 2017 to participate in a survey in which diverse household characteristics, socioeconomic data, and health status variables were collected, as well as airborne dust samples from the household. Participants were instructed to place electrostatic dust collectors at a height of at least 1.25 meters above floor level in the main living room. Out of 600 homes selected to represent different housing characteristics, to which invitations were sent, seventy-nine ultimately provided the answered questionnaires and household dust samples. Only one adult per household provided responses to the questionnaire including their health status and was responsible for collecting and delivering the samples.

The Nigerian samples are from a case-control study of the relationship between indoor airborne dust microbiome and childhood lower respiratory tract infections.[@fakunle2023a]

Phyloseq object containing both NL and NG samples + controls:

```{r}
fungi_NL_fakunle2023a <- readRDS(
  paste0(inputfolder,
         "/Updated_set1+2_ITS1_Nigerian+NL_dust+controls_20240614.rds")
  ) 
fungi_NL_fakunle2023a
```

Only residential households were kept, since this was similarly done with retrieved samples from studies captured in the literature review to reduce the number of samples to process. This was done under the assumption that quality control has already been done for all published and unpublished studies.

Phyloseq object containing both NL and NG samples, after removing controls:

```{r}
fungi_NL_fakunle2023a <- subset_samples(fungi_NL_fakunle2023a, Sam_type %in% c("NL","NG"))
fungi_NL_fakunle2023a
```

```{r}
sample_sum_plot(fungi_NL_fakunle2023a)
```

Since there is limited metadata from other studies that would allow comparison by additional environmental determinants or health outcome, this analysis will be limited to a comparison by the country of origin of the samples.

```{r}
sample_data(fungi_NL_fakunle2023a) <- sample_data(fungi_NL_fakunle2023a) %>% 
  data.frame %>% 
  select(SamID, Sam_type) %>% 
  rename(SampleNames = SamID,
         Country = Sam_type)

The GenusSpecies rank is missing in the NL and NG data. I will remove it and check if they are not equal:

```{r}
tax_table(fungi_adams2020a) <- tax_table(fungi_adams2020a)[, -which(rank_names(fungi_adams2020a) == "GenusSpecies")]

tax_table(fungi_hickman2022a) <- tax_table(fungi_hickman2022a)[, -which(rank_names(fungi_hickman2022a) == "GenusSpecies")]

all.equal(
  rank_names(fungi_adams2020a), 
  rank_names(fungi_hickman2022a), 
  rank_names(fungi_NL_fakunle2023a)
  )
```

Merge into a single phyloseq object

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Merge the phyloseq objects
fungi <- merge_phyloseq(
  fungi_adams2020a, 
  fungi_hickman2022a,

rm(fungi_adams2020a, 
  fungi_hickman2022a,

Save unrarefied data:

#| echo: true

Sample sums plot:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sample_sum_plot(fungi, color = "Country", percentKeep = 90)

ggsave(
  filename = "sample_sum_plot.png",
  path = figfolder,
  width = 12, 
  height = 8,
  units = "in", 
  dpi = 300
)
```

![](images/sample_sum_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

I will keep 90% of samples.

```{r}
#| eval: false
sample_sums <- sample_sums(fungi)

samples_keep <- names(sample_sums[sample_sums >= 742])

fungi <- prune_samples(samples_keep, fungi)

rm(sample_sums)

#Check that it matches number in figure
nsamples(fungi)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
saveRDS(
  fungi, 
  paste0(psfolder,"/fungi_keep.rds")
)
```

The construction of rarefaction curves was done with the following script:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
source("scripts/rarefaction_plot_fungi.R")
```

I will rarefy at 2,500 which leads to loosing close to \~10% (n=57) of samples.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
source("scripts/rarefy_fungi.R")
```

After multiple attempts to rarefy, I was not able to do it. Thus, I will continue with the analyses on the unrarefied data.

# Beta diversity 

PCoA plot will be generated with the following code: 

```{r}

Process takes too long and I have not been able to create ordination figures. Thus, I will keep the analysis up to here.
