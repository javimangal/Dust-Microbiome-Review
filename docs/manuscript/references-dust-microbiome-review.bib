abstract = {Airborne microorganisms are associated with human health and awareness of the important influence of nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) on health has risen. Thus, we analyzed the micro-sized microbes (m-MBs) and nano-sized microbial EVs (n-MEVs) of outdoor and indoor air through a field study in Seoul, Korea. We conducted 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of m-MBs and n-MEVs in outdoor airborne dust (OAD), indoor airborne dust (IAD), and indoor dust from carpets (IDC). The dominant taxa in OAD were altered depending upon the outside environment, such as sunny, haze, and rainy. Also, dominant taxa in IAD and IDC were changed depending on the outside environment. In addition, there were differences of microbiome composition and diversity between the m-MB and n-MEV in OAD, IAD, and IDC. m-MB in OAD were more correlated with that of IDC, whereas n-MEVs in OAD were more related to those in IAD. Thus, indoor bioaerosols can be affected by different source according to bioaerosol size. Additionally, risk of bioaerosols can be different according to dominant taxa, and therefore we suggested that further study for risk of dominant taxa according to environments is necessary. We suggested that nano-sized microbial EVs should be included as parameters to manage air quality.},

abstract = {Indoor microbiome exposure is important for asthma development, but current studies characterize the microbiome at the genus or above levels due to technical limitations. We aim to profile bacterial and fungal composition and concentration at the species level and assess its potential health effects. Four hundred sixty-three students from 8 junior high schools in Terengganu, Malaysia, were surveyed for asthma symptoms. Full-length PacBio amplicon sequencing and qPCR were conducted to quantify the absolute microbial concentration in the vacuum dust of the selected classroom. In total, 1358 bacterial and 358 fungal species were characterized, and drastic compositional variation was observed among classrooms. Three-level linear regression analyses revealed that taxa richness in Cyanobacteria were negatively associated with asthma (FDR {\textless} 0.001). The absolute concentration of Nocardioides exalbidus was protectively associated with asthma, and four bacteria species were positively associated with asthma (FDR {\textless} 0.1). Interestingly, all five species were recently isolated and characterized in Asian countries and never reported to associate with asthma. Indoor NO2 and formaldehyde concentration were associated with the overall bacterial community variation and fungal richness, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). No environmental characteristics were directly associated with asthma, but indoor relative humidity, CO2 concentration, and weight of vacuum dust were associated with the asthma-related species (p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting a potential indirect health effect on students. This is the first study to characterize indoor microbiome and asthma-associated microorganisms at the species level, representing a region-specific microbiome exposure pattern in a tropical Asian country.},

abstract = {Background We have previously found an inverse association of bacterial diversity with childhood asthma. It remains unclear whether certain bacteria account for the protective effect. Methods The high variability of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene allows assessing diversity and specificity of bacterial communities by single-strand configuration polymorphism (SSCP). DNA was extracted from mattress dust samples of 489 school-age children from rural and suburban regions in Germany. A fragment of the bacteria-specific 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR, digested to single-strand DNA, and subjected to electrophoresis. The resulting band patterns reflect the underlying DNA sequences. The individual bands were tested for associations with asthma, hay fever, and atopy in quantitative and qualitative multivariable analyses. Significantly associated bands were isolated and sequenced. The sequences were compared to a database, and distinct bacteria were identified. Results Seven of 76 independent bands were found to be inversely associated with asthma, atopic sensitization, and hay fever with odds ratios ranging from 0.17 to 0.73. The bands contained the sequences of Acinetobacter sp., Lactobacillus spp., Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus sciuri, Jeotgalicoccus sp., Corynebacterium spp., and others. Conclusions In a diverse microbial environment, certain bacteria may account for the protective effect on the development of asthma and atopy. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Purpose: Recently, there has been a rise in the interest to understand the composition of indoor dust due to its association with lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Furthermore, it has been found that bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) within indoor dust particles can induce pulmonary inflammation, suggesting that these might play a role in lung disease. Methods: We performed microbiome analysis of indoor dust EVs isolated from mattresses in apartments and hospitals. We developed diagnostic models based on the bacterial EVs antibodies detected in serum samples via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in this analysis. Results: Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial EV taxa observed at the phylum level while Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae (f) and Acinetobacter were the most prominent organisms at the genus level, followed by Staphylococcus. Based on the microbiome analysis, serum anti-bacterial EV immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1 and IgG4 were analyzed using ELISA with EV antibodies that targeted Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The levels of anti-bacterial EV antibodies were found to be significantly higher in patients with asthma, COPD and lung cancer compared to the healthy control group. We then developed a diagnostic model through logistic regression of antibodies that showed significant differences between groups with smoking history as a covariate. Four different variable selection methods were compared to construct an optimal diagnostic model with area under the curves ranging from 0.72 to 0.81. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ELISA-based analysis of anti-bacterial EV antibodies titers can be used as a diagnostic tool for lung disease. The present findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of lung disease as well as a foundation for developing a novel diagnostic methodology that synergizes microbial EV metagenomics and immune assays.},

Recent research established that humans are the main drivers of the indoor microbiome and up to now significant literature has been produced about this topic. Here we analyzed differences in bacterial composition between men's and women's restrooms and other common areas within the same public building. Bacterial DNA samples were collected from restrooms and halls of a three-floor building from the Federal University of Pampa, RS, Brazil. The bacterial community was characterized by amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing. Throughout all samples, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Beta diversity metrics showed that the structure of the bacterial communities were different among the areas and floors tested, however, only 6–9{\%} of the variation in bacterial communities was explained by the area and floors sampled. A few microorganisms showed significantly differential abundance between men's and women's restrooms, but in general, the bacterial communities from both places were very similar. Finally, significant differences among the microbial community profile from different floors were reported, suggesting that the type of use and occupant demographic within the building may directly influence bacterial dispersion and establishment.},

To date, however, the particular environmental exposure(s) from water-damaged buildings that causes the health effects have not been identified. Likewise, a consistent quantitative measurement that would indicate whether a building is water damaged or poses a health risk to occupants has not been found. In this work, we tried to develop analytical tools that would find a microbial signal of moisture damage amid the noisy background of microorganisms in buildings. The most successful approach taken here focused on particular groups of fungi—those considered likely to grow in damp indoor environments—and their associations with observed moisture damage.

PCR-denaturing gradient gel analysis (PCR-DGGE) demonstrated that the bacterial community structure in house dust is significantly impacted by the presence of dogs or cats in the home ( P = 0.0190 and 0.0029, respectively) and by whether or not children attend day care ( P = 0.0037). In addition, significant differences in the dust bacterial community were associated with asthma outcomes in young children, including wheezing ( P = 0.0103) and specific IgE ( P = 0.0184).

abstract = {Despite an expanding array of molecular approaches for detecting microorganisms in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of the microbial cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. A propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with downstream quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and pyrosequencing analyses was carried out to better understand the frequency, diversity, and distribution of viable microorganisms associated with debris collected from the crew quarters of the International Space Station (ISS). The cultured bacterial counts were more in the ISS samples than cultured fungal population. The rapid molecular analyses targeted to estimate viable population exhibited 5-fold increase in bacterial (qPCR-PMA assay) and 25-fold increase in microbial (adenosine triphosphate assay) burden than the cultured bacterial population. The ribosomal nucleic acid-based identification of cultivated strains revealed the presence of only four to eight bacterial species in the ISS samples, however, the viable bacterial diversity detected by the PMA-pyrosequencing method was far more diverse (12 to 23 bacterial taxa) with the majority consisting of members of actinobacterial genera (Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium) and Staphylococcus. Sample fractions not treated with PMA (inclusive of both live and dead cells) yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial (94 to 118 taxa) and fungal lineages (41 taxa). Even though deep sequencing capability of the molecular analysis widened the understanding about the microbial diversity, the cultivation assay also proved to be essential since some of the spore-forming microorganisms were detected only by the culture-based method. Presented here are the findings of the first comprehensive effort to assess the viability of microbial cells associated with ISS surfaces, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

However, the characteristics of bacterial community in indoor dust from university dormitory and their potential health risks are largely unknown. In this study, the bacterial community of 12 indoor dust samples from university dormitories was characterized by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the three most abundant bacteria at the phylum level, while Acinetobacter, Paracoccus and Kocuria were the most dominating genera. Some potentially pathogenic bacteria were identified in the indoor dusts, including Acinetobacter spp., Kocuria spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Bacillus spp. Alpha and beta diversity showed that the bacterial community was different among different samples. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) demonstrated that the major microbial functions in dusts were membrane transport, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. While, chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrate reduction were the dominant functional groups according to the FAPROTAX. Significantly positive correlations were revealed between human diseases related microbial functions and some bacterial genera, indicating the potential health risks of bacteria in university dormitory.

We aimed to characterize the changes in human nasopharyngeal bacteriome after short-term exposure to indoor (workplace) environments. Methods: In this pilot study, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 22 participants in the morning and after 8 h of their presence at the workplace. At the same time points, indoor dust samples were collected from the participants' households (16 from flats and 6 from houses) and workplaces (8 from a maternity hospital – NEO, 6 from a pediatric hospital – ENT, and 8 from a research center – RCX). 16S rRNA sequencing analysis was performed on these human and environmental matrices. Results: Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium were the most abundant genera in both indoor dust and nasopharyngeal samples. The analysis indicated lower bacterial diversity in indoor dust samples from flats compared to houses, NEO, ENT, and RCX (p {\textless} 0.05). Participants working in the NEO had the highest nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity of all groups (p {\textless} 0.05). After 8 h of exposure to the workplace environment, enrichment of the nasopharynx with several new bacterial genera present in the indoor dust was observed in 76{\%} of study participants; however, no significant changes were observed at the level of the nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity (p {\textgreater} 0.05, Shannon index). These “enriching” bacterial genera overlapped between the hospital workplaces – NEO and ENT but differed from those in the research center – RCX. Conclusions: The results suggest that although the composition of nasopharyngeal bacteriome is relatively stable during the day. Short-term exposure to the indoor environment can result in the enrichment of the nasopharynx with bacterial DNA from indoor dust; the bacterial composition, however, varies by the indoor workplace environment.},

abstract = {Background: Indoor microbial contamination due to excess moisture is an important contributor to human illness in both residential and occupational settings. However, the census of microorganisms in the indoor environment is limited by the use of selective, culture-based detection techniques. By using clone library sequencing of full-length internal transcribed spacer region combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 69 fungal species or assay groups and cultivation, we have been able to generate a more comprehensive description of the total indoor mycoflora. Using this suite of methods, we assessed the impact of moisture damage on the fungal community composition of settled dust and building material samples (n = 8 and 16, correspondingly). Water-damaged buildings (n = 2) were examined pre- and post- remediation, and compared with undamaged reference buildings (n = 2). Results: Culture-dependent and independent methods were consistent in the dominant fungal taxa in dust, but sequencing revealed a five to ten times higher diversity at the genus level than culture or qPCR. Previously unknown, verified fungal phylotypes were detected in dust, accounting for 12{\%} of all diversity. Fungal diversity, especially within classes Dothideomycetes and Agaricomycetes tended to be higher in the water damaged buildings. Fungal phylotypes detected in building materials were present in dust samples, but their proportion of total fungi was similar for damaged and reference buildings. The quantitative correlation between clone library phylotype frequencies and qPCR counts was moderate (r = 0.59, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: We examined a small number of target buildings and found indications of elevated fungal diversity associated with water damage. Some of the fungi in dust were attributable to building growth, but more information on the material-associated communities is needed in order to understand the dynamics of microbial communities between building structures and dust. The sequencing-based method proved indispensable for describing the true fungal diversity in indoor environments. However, making conclusions concerning the effect of building conditions on building mycobiota using this methodology was complicated by the wide natural diversity in the dust samples, the incomplete knowledge of material-associated fungi fungi and the semiquantitative nature of sequencing based methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Pitk{\"{a}}ranta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background. We spend most of our lives in indoor environments and are exposed to microbes present in these environments. Hence, knowledge about this exposure is important for understanding how it impacts on human health. However, the bacterial flora in indoor environments has been only fragmentarily explored and mostly using culture methods. The application of molecular methods previously utilised in other environments has resulted in a substantial increase in our awareness of microbial diversity. Results. The composition and dynamics of indoor dust bacterial flora were investigated in two buildings over a period of one year. Four samples were taken in each building, corresponding to the four seasons, and 16S rDNA libraries were constructed. A total of 893 clones were analysed and 283 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected among them using 97{\%} sequence similarity as the criterion. All libraries were dominated by Gram-positive sequences, with the most abundant phylum being Firmicutes. Four OTUs having high similarity to Corynebacterium-, Propionibacterium-, Streptococcus- and Staphylococcus- sequences were present in all samples. The most abundant of the Gram-negative OTUs were members of the family Sphingomonadaceae, followed by Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Neisseriaceae and Rhizobiaceae. The relative abundance of alpha- and betaproteobacteria increased slightly towards summer at the expense of firmicutes. The proportion of firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria of the total diversity was highest in winter and that of actinobacteria, alpha- and betaproteobacteria in spring or summer, whereas the diversity of bacteroidetes peaked in fall. A statistical comparison of the libraries revealed that the bacterial flora of the two buildings differed during all seasons except spring, but differences between seasons within one building were not that clear, indicating that differences between the buildings were greater than the differences between seasons. Conclusion. This work demonstrated that the bacterial flora of indoor dust is complex and dominated by Gram-positive species. The dominant phylotypes most probably originated from users of the building. Seasonal variation was observed as proportional changes of the phyla and at the species level. The microflora of the two buildings investigated differed statistically and differences between the buildings were more pronounced than differences between seasons. {\textcopyright} 2008 Rintala et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities were quantified from homes within the Cherokee Nation in North Eastern, Oklahoma, USA, where seasonal air exchange rates (AERs) were measured, and seasonal outdoor and indoor air, floor dust, and settled dust samples were collected. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and DNA amplicon sequencing were paired with a mass balance model to determine if high and low ventilation rate regimes impacted bacterial and fungal concentration and community structure, and to estimate the relative contributions of microbiota to indoor air from infiltration of outdoor air (ventilation) versus indoor emissions. For indoor PM10 and settled dusts samples, comparative analyses of microbial communities revealed no significant bacterial or fungal community differences between samples taken from homes dichotomized into high (average high AER = 0.56 hr−1) and low (average low AER = 0.16 hr−1) AER regimes (p {\textgreater} 0.1 for all), suggesting that ventilation was not a significant factor controlling bacterial and fungal concentrations and ecologies in the indoor air of these homes. A comparison between indoor emissions (typically due to occupancy and resuspension) and ventilation (infiltration of outdoor air) as a source of bacteria and fungi indicates that indoor emissions are the dominant source of particulate matter, bacteria, and fungi, accounting for {\~{}}94{\%} indoor air PM10, {\~{}}97{\%} of indoor air bacteria, and {\~{}}91{\%} of indoor air fungi. Thus, indoor emission sources must be controlled to significantly impact human bacterial and fungal (allergen) exposure in the indoor air of these residential environments.},

abstract = {Concerns regarding the potential health effects of microorganisms in the indoor environment paired with recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have led to a rapid expansion in microbial studies of the built environment. The objective of this study is to compare the microbial communities recovered from six different samplers placed in the same building to assess how sample selection can impact the interpretation of the indoor microbiome. To this end, pyrosequencing was used to delineate the fungal and bacterial communities recovered from six samplers placed in an occupied retail building over two consecutive sampling events spaced one week apart. The microbial communities (335K+sequences) were much more diverse in the settled dust and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter dust samples than the communities recovered from the shorter term, composite samples collected in four different bioaerosol samplers. The bacterial communities recovered from a given sampler were in general more similar to communities from the same samplers than to communities recovered during the same sampling event. Only 14{\%} of the bacterial OTUs and 44{\%} of the fungal OTUs detected were shared in all four bioaerosol samplers, despite the fact that the samplers were collocated and sampled the indoor air simultaneously. These results indicate that sample type should be considered when interpreting results, particularly when comparing results across multiple studies that use different sampling techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

The presented research was aimed at determining the quantitative and qualitative diversity of air in underground mining excavations. Microbiological tests of air samples were carried out according to standard microbiological techniques. The study of microbial communities made it possible to determine the unit concentrations of microorganisms, identify potential pathogens, and analyze the manner of their spread in the air of an underground mine. A large number and variety of microorganisms were observed in the bioaerosol, including pathogenic ones (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus) that may pose a potential threat to humans by causing lung and skin diseases. Due to the insufficient state of global knowledge in this area of research the obtained results are helpful in the modernization of existing and designing new mining excavation ventilation systems, as well as in refreshing particularly hazardous places.},

abstract = {Natural passive ventilation (windows opening) is frequently used in many houses and old buildings to renovate the air, remove unpleasant odors and dust, and reduce the physicochemical pollutants indoor. However, little is known about the effect on biological particles such as pollen grains and fungal spores (both allergenic) or bacteria (potentially infectious and pathogenic). In the present research, the bioaerosols composition in a small room naturally ventilated was analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Pollen grains were the most abundant particles outdoors while microbial phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were predominant indoors. The main divergences in bioaerosols between indoor and outdoor environments were caused by the different abundance of the biological particles rather than the different taxa composition. Keeping the window open for 2 h did not change significantly the microbial community present indoors, although there was a tendency to mix the components of both environments. The abundance of human-related and potentially harmful microorganisms was higher indoors and was not remarkably affected by natural ventilation. In our study, natural ventilation through window opening had a poor effect on removing these microorganisms from the atmosphere indoor, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as air filtering systems would be required in order to improve the air quality of these environments from a microbiological point of view.},

However, no studies report the interactions between environmental characteristics, indoor microbiome and health effects in a repeated cross-sectional framework. Methods: 1,279 and 1,121 preschool children in an industrial city (Taiyuan) of China were assessed for asthma, rhinitis and eczema symptoms in 2012 and 2019 by self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Bacteria and fungi in classroom vacuum dust were characterized by culture-independent amplicon sequencing. Multi-level logistic/linear regression was performed in two cross-sectional and two combined models to assess the associations. Results: The number of observed species in bacterial and fungal communities in classrooms increased significantly from 2012 to 2019, and the compositions of the microbial communities were drastically changed (p {\textless} 0.001). The temporal microbiome variation was significantly larger than the spatial variation within the city (p {\textless} 0.001). Annual average outdoor SO2 concentration decreased by 60.7{\%}, whereas NO2 and PM10 concentrations increased by 63.3{\%} and 40.0{\%} from 2012 to 2019, which were both associated with indoor microbiome variation (PERMANOVA p {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of asthma (2.0{\%} to 3.3{\%}, p = 0.06) and rhinitis (28.0{\%} to 25.3{\%}, p = 0.13) were not significantly changed, but the prevalence of eczema was increased (3.6{\%} to 7.0{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). Aspergillus subversicolor, Collinsella and Cutibacterium were positively associated with asthma, rhinitis and eczema, respectively (p {\textless} 0.01). Prevotella, Lactobacillus iners and Dolosigranulum were protectively (negatively) associated with rhinitis (p {\textless} 0.01), consistent with previous studies in the human respiratory tract. NO2 and PM10 concentrations were negatively associated with rhinitis in a bivariate model, but a multivariate mediation analysis revealed that Prevotella fully mediated the health effects. Conclusions: This is the first study to report the interactions between environmental characteristics, indoor microbiome and health in a repeated cross-sectional framework. The mediating effects of indoor microorganisms suggest incorporating biological with chemical exposure for a comprehensive exposure assessment.},

Indoor surface microbial communities are formed from several sources, environmental and anthropogenic.

The composition of the dust bacterial community was significantly different from the other tested surfaces (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the dust fungal community was only significantly different from fingers (P {\textless} 0.05). Bacterial and fungal communities were both shaped by deterministic processes, and bacterial communities had a higher migration rate. Results of a network analysis showed that the microbial community interactions of keyboards and mice were mainly competitive. Fast expectation–maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST) identified the sources of {\textgreater} 70 {\%} of the keyboard and mouse microbial communities. Biomarkers for each sample types were identified by LDA Effect Size (LEfSE) analysis, some of which were soil-derived and potential anthropogenic pathogens, indicating the potential for exchange of microbes among outdoor, human and indoor surfaces. The current study shows that the source of microorganisms at the office interface is highly traceable and that their migration is linked to human activity. The migration of potentially pathogenic microbes were identified, emphasising the importance of personal hygiene.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to public health worldwide. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in human airways and relevant environments has not received significant attention. In this study, abundances of ARGs and microbes from airborne particulate matter, dust, and human airways in a hospital were profiled using high-throughput qPCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. More diverse ARGs and microbes in indoor dust and higher levels of ARGs in particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 were observed. Macrolides and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the most abundant ARGs in the airway and environmental samples, respectively. Moreover, the co-occurrences of priority pathogens, ARGs, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were shown by the Network analysis. Campylobacter spp. and Staphylococcus spp. positively correlated with fluoroquinolone (vatC-02, mexD) and $\beta$-lactams (blaZ, mecA) resistance genes, respectively. In this regard, based on SourceTracker analysis, inhalable particles contributed to 4.0{\%} to 5.5{\%} of ARGs in human airway samples, suggesting an important exchange between airborne inhalable particles and human commensals. This study may advance knowledge about ARGs in airborne particulate matter and dust associated environments, reveal their potential link between environments and humans, and provide a new sight and fundamental data for ARG risk assessment.},

In this study, we collected floor dust and environmental characteristics from 21 classrooms, and health data related to asthma symptoms from 309 students, in junior high schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The bacterial and fungal composition was characterized by sequencing 16s rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and the absolute microbial concentration was quantified by qPCR. In total, 326 bacterial and 255 fungal genera were characterized. Five bacterial (Sphingobium, Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia, Solirubrobacter, Pleurocapsa) and two fungal (Torulaspora and Leptosphaeriaceae) taxa were protective for asthma severity. Two bacterial taxa, Izhakiella and Robinsoniella, were positively associated with asthma severity. Several protective bacterial taxa including Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia and Sphingobium have been reported as protective microbes in previous studies, whereas other taxa were first time reported. Environmental characteristics, such as age of building, size of textile curtain per room volume, occurrence of cockroaches, concentration of house dust mite allergens transferred from homes by the occupants, were involved in shaping the overall microbial community but not asthma-associated taxa; whereas visible dampness and mold, which did not change the overall microbial community for floor dust, was negatively associated with the concentration of protective bacteria Rhodomicrobium ($\beta$ = −2.86, p = 0.021) of asthma. The result indicates complex interactions between microbes, environmental characteristics and asthma symptoms. Overall, this is the first indoor microbiome study to characterize the asthma-associated microbes and their environmental determinant in the tropical area, promoting the understanding of microbial exposure and respiratory health in this region.},

Here, we surveyed the bacterial and fungal communities, and the resistome in settled dust gathered from 82 homes located across Beijing, China, employing Illumina sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR techniques. There was no clear geographical distribution pattern in dust-related bacterial communities although a slight but significant (P {\textless} 0.05) distance-decay relationship occurred in its community similarity; by contrast, a relatively distinct geographical clustering and a stronger distance-decay relationship were observed in fungal communities at the local scale. The cross-domain (bacteria versus fungi) relationships in the microbiome of the dust samples were mostly observed as robust co-occurrence correlations. The bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, with human skin, soil and plants being potential major sources. The fungal communities largely comprised potential allergens (a median 61{\%} of the fungal sequences), with Alternaria genus within Ascomycota phylum being the most predominant taxa. The profile of dust-related bacterial communities was mainly affected by housing factors related to occupants and houseplants, while that of fungal communities was determined by georeferenced environmental factors, particularly vascular plant diversity. Additionally, a great diversity (1.96 on average for Shannon index) and normalized abundance (2.22 copies per bacterial cell on average) of antibiotic resistance genes were detected across the dust samples, with the dominance of genes resistant to vancomycin and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B. The resistome profile exhibited no distinct geographical pattern, and was primarily driven by certain bacterial phyla and occupancy-related factors. Overall, we underline the significance of anthropogenic impacts and house location in structuring bacterial and fungal communities inside homes, respectively, and suggest that household dust is an overlooked reservoir for antibiotic resistance.},

The study included 158 children recruited from a birth cohort study, and 32 were physician-diagnosed as asthmatic. The relationship between eNO levels and exposures to home dust streptomycetes, endotoxin, and molds was investigated. Streptomycetes and endotoxin were analyzed both as loads and concentrations in separate models. Dog, cat, and dust mite allergens also were evaluated. In the multivariate exposure models, high streptomycetes loads and concentrations were significantly associated with a decrease in eNO levels in asthmatic (p{\textless}. 0.001) but not in healthy children. The presence of dog allergen, however, was associated with increased levels of eNO (p= 0.001). Dust endotoxin was not significant. The relationship between eNO and indoor exposure to common outdoor molds was u-shaped. In non-asthmatic children, none of the exposure variables was significantly associated with eNO levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a significant association between microbial components in the indoor environment and eNO levels in asthmatic children. This study demonstrates the importance of simultaneously assessing multiple home exposures of asthmatic children to better understand opposing effects.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental factors can influence the house dust microbiota, which may impact health outcomes. Little is known about how farming exposures impact the indoor microbiota. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify exposures related to bacterial communities in house dust in a U.S. farming population. METHODS: We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in vacuumed dust samples from the bedrooms of a subset of 879 households of farmers and farmers' spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study (ALHS), a case–control study of asthma nested within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) in North Carolina and Iowa. Information on current farming (past 12 mo), including both crop and animal farming, and other potential microbial sources was obtained via questionnaires. We used linear regression to evaluate associations between exposures and bacterial diversity within each sample, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to identify exposures related to diversity between samples, and analysis of composition of microbiome to examine whether exposures related to diversity were also related to differential abundance of specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs). RESULTS: Current farming was positively associated with bacterial diversity in house dust, with or without adjustment for nonfarm exposures related to diversity, including presence of indoor pets, home condition, and season of dust collection. Many taxa exhibited differential abundance related to farming. Some taxa in the phyla Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia were associated [false discovery rate FDR {\textless} 0:05] with farming but not with other nonfarm factors. Many taxa correlated with the concentration of house dust of endotoxin, commonly studied as a general marker of exposure to the farming environment. CONCLUSIONS: In this farming population, house dust microbiota differed by current farming status. Understanding the determinants of the indoor microbiota is the first step toward understanding potential relationships with health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3145},

abstract = {Background: Investigations in urban areas have just begun to explore how the indoor dust microbiome may affect the pathogenesis of asthma and allery. oBjective: We aimed to investigate the early fungal and bacterial microbiome in house dust with allergic sensitization and wheezing later in childhood. Methods: Individual dust samples from 189 homes of the LISAplus birth cohort study were collected shortly after birth from living room floors and profiled for fungal and bacterial microbiome. Fungal and bacterial diversity was assessed with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP) and defined by Simpson's Diversity Index. Information on wheezing outcomes and covariates until the age of 10 years was obtained by parent questionnaires. Information on specific allergic sensitization was available at child's age 6 and 10 years. Logistic regression and general estimation equation (GEE) models were used to examine the relationship between microbial diversity and health outcomes. results: Adjusted logistic regression analyses revealed a significantly reduced risk of developing sensitization to aero-allergens at 6 years and ever wheezing until the age of 10 years for exposure to higher fungal diversity [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.26 (95{\%} CI: 0.10, 0.70), and 0.42 (95{\%} CI: 0.18, 0.96), respectively]. The associations were attenuated for the longitudinal analyses (GEE) until the age of 10 years. There was no association between higher exposure to bacterial diversity and the tested health outcomes. conclusion: Higher early exposure to fungal diversity might help to prevent a child from developing sensitization to aero-allergens in early childhood, but the reasons for attenuated effects in later childhood require further prospective studies.},

At 6 and 18 months, the child was assessed for eczema by clinicians. In the eczema group, household environmental microbiota was characterized by presence of human‐associated bacteria Actinomyces , Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium at all time points, suggesting their possible contributions to regulating host immunity and increasing the susceptibility to eczema. In the home environment of the control group, putative protective effect of an environmental microbe Planomicrobium ( Planococcaceae family) was observed to be significantly higher than that in the eczema group. Network correlation analysis demonstrated inverse relationships between beneficial Planomicrobium and human‐associated bacteria ( Actinomyces , Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium ). Exposure to natural environmental microbiota may be beneficial to modulate shed human‐associated microbiota in an indoor environment.},

abstract = {More than in any other habitat, humans exert a large influence on microbial communities indoors. Frequent contact between occupant skin and indoor surfaces causes indoor surface microbial communities to be largely assembled from and thus closely resemble occupant skin microbiomes. While indoor air and dust are known to also contain many human‐associated taxa, household air communities have not yet been directly compared with occupant skin microbiomes. We sampled microorganisms from air, surfaces and occupant skin in 19 H ong K ong households and used Illumina sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene to investigate the dispersal relationships between the bacterial communities at each site. Our results confirmed that indoor surfaces bear the ‘bacterial fingerprint' of household occupant skin. However, while air communities contained abundant human‐associated taxa and were household specific, air communities in each household did not resemble occupant skin from that household any more than occupant skin from other households. Our results suggest that, at least in H ong K ong, indoor air bacterial communities may be assembled largely from outdoor air and occupant body sites other than skin, and unlike surface communities do not harbour the occupants' skin ‘bacterial fingerprint'.},

abstract = {An exposure to diverse microbial population early in life is important for the development of immunity against various non-communicable diseases including asthma, childhood leukaemia and other cancers. Social mixing in daycare settings helps with exposure to a variety of microbes. However, social isolation and a high emphasis on workplace hygiene during the COVID pandemic may have affected children's exposure to diverse microbiota. The structure of microbial communities and their role in developing immunity to various diseases are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the structure of microbial communities in daycare and home settings during the pandemic. Interestingly, microbial diversity was relatively higher in dust samples collected from homes, with human-associated taxa being more prevalent compared to those from daycare settings. Environmental microbes were more abundant in dust samples from daycare providers. These results potentially suggest that cleaning practices during the pandemic may have influenced the diversity and microbial abundance of the daycare samples. Several bacterial taxa detected in both the environments are known to induce anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses, conferring protection from various diseases. Therefore, exposure to diverse microbial population in early childhood may play an important role in developing immunity against various non-communicable and infectious diseases.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the dynamics of airborne microbial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in space life support systems is important because potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance pose a health risk to crew that can lead to mission failure. There have been few reports on the distribution patterns of microbiomes and ARGs in space life support systems. In particular, there have been no detailed investigations of microbiomes and/or antibiotic resistance based on molecular methods in long-term confined bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). Therefore, in the present study, we collected air dust samples from two crew shifts, different areas, and different time points in the "Lunar Palace 365" experiment. We evaluated microbial diversity, species composition, functional potential, and antibiotic resistance by combining cultivation-independent analyses (amplicon, shot-gun sequencing, and qPCR). Results: We found that the bacterial community diversity in the Lunar Palace1 (LP1) system was higher than that in a controlled environment but lower than that in an open environment. Personnel exchange led to significant differences in bacterial community diversity, and source tracking analysis revealed that most bacteria in the air derived from the cabin crew and plants, but no differences in microbial function or antibiotic resistance were observed. Thus, human presence had the strongest effect on the succession of microbial diversity in the BLSSs. Conclusions: Our results highlight that microbial diversity in BLSSs is heavily influenced by changes in crew and is unique from other open and controlled environments. Our findings can be used to help develop safe, enclosed BLSS that meet the requirements of human survival and habitation in outer space. In addition, our results can further enhance our understanding of the indoor air microbial community and effectively maintain a safe working and living environment, including plant growth.},

In the present study, we assessed the bacterial community and ARGs in the air dust and surface environments of a typical spacecraft assembly cleanroom. Our results show a significant difference in bacterial composition between surfaces and air dust, as they belong to two distinct ecostates. Bacillus and Acinetobacter were significantly enriched in the air samples. Bacterial community network analysis revealed lower topological parameters and robustness of bacterial networks in the air samples. We also observed different distribution patterns of some typical ARGs between surface and air dust samples. Notably, the ermB gene exhibited a relatively high copy number and was enriched in the surface environment, compared to that in the air. Overall, our study provides insight into the complex microbial community and the distribution and transfer of ARGs in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and offers important input for developing control strategies against ARGs.},

Considering there is a gap of investigation of dust ARGs, 16 S rRNA gene sequences and high-throughput quantitative PCR were employed to obtain information of microbial communities and accumulated ARGs in dust from different urban places, including the malls, hospitals, schools and parks, to investigate the distribution and influencing factors of ARGs and discover the potential hosts of ARGs in dust. Here, 9 types of ARGs such as sulfonamide, tetracycline, and beta-lactamase and 71 subtypes of ARGs like sul1, tetM-01, and drfA1 were detected in dust. ARGs had varying distribution in different public places and seasons in dust. The abundances of total ARGs, MLSB and tetracycline genes were higher in spring than summer. The diversity of ARGs was highest in malls, follow by hospitals, schools, and parks. Additionally, multi-drug resistance genes in dust were more abundant in hospitals than in schools and parks. The microbes were distinguished as the most important driving factors for ARGs in dust, followed by the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and different places, while dust physicochemical parameters only exert a negligible impact. Notably, several opportunistic pathogens like the Streptococcus, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas were inferred as potential hosts of high-risk ARGs such as mecA, tetM-02, and tetO-01 in dust because of strongly positive co-occurrence. These results imply that dust is likely an important reservoir of ARGs. We should realize that ARGs may be harbored in some opportunistic pathogens occur in dust and endanger human health because of dust contacting to human easily.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine and compare environmental microbiota from dust and children's respiratory health outcomes at ages seven and twelve. At age seven, in-home visits were conducted for children enrolled in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS). Floor dust was collected and analyzed for bacterial (16 S rRNA gene) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer region) microbiota. Respiratory outcomes, including physician-diagnosed asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitivity were assessed by physical examination and caregiver-report at ages seven and twelve. The associations between dust microbiota and respiratory outcomes were evaluated using Permanova, DESeq, and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models. Four types of WQS regression models were run to identify mixtures of fungi or bacteria that were associated with the absence or presence of health outcomes. For alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria, no significant associations were found with respiratory health outcomes. DESeq identified specific bacterial and fungal indicator taxa that were higher or lower with the presence of different health outcomes. Most individual indicator fungal species were lower with asthma and wheeze and higher with aeroallergen positivity and rhinitis, whereas bacterial data was less consistent. WQS regression models demonstrated that a combination of species might influence health outcomes. Several heavily weighted species had a strong influence on the models, and therefore, created a microbial community that was associated with the absence or presence of asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen+. Weights for specific species within WQS regression models supported indicator taxa findings. Health outcomes might be more influenced by the composition of a complex mixture of bacterial and fungal species in the indoor environment than by the absence or presence of individual species. This study demonstrates that WQS is a useful tool in evaluating mixtures in relation to potential health effects.},

However, indoor microbiome composition can be highly diverse and dynamic, and thus current studies fail to produce consistent results. Chinese university dormitories are special high-density dwellings with similar building and occupants characteristics, which facilitate to disentangle the complex interactions between microbes, environmental characteristics and asthma. Settled air dust and floor dust was collected from 87 dormitory rooms in Shanxi University. Bacterial communities were characterized by 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Students (n = 357) were surveyed for asthma symptoms and measured for fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Asthma was not associated with the overall bacterial richness but associated with specific phylogenetic classes. Taxa richness and abundance in Clostridia, including Ruminococcus, Blautia, Clostridium and Subdoligranulum, were positively associated with asthma (p {\textless} 0.05), and these taxa were mainly derived from the human gut. Taxa richness in Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were marginally protectively associated with asthma, and these taxa were mainly derived from the outdoor environment. Bacterial richness and abundance were not associated with FeNO levels. Building age was associated with overall bacterial community variation in air and floor dust (p {\textless} 0.05), but not associated with the asthma-related microorganisms. Our data shows that taxa from different phylogenetic classes and derived habitats have different health effects, indicating the importance of incorporating phylogenetic and ecological concepts in revealing patterns in the microbiome asthma association analysis.},

abstract = {Background: The influence of outdoor green space on microbial communities indoors has scarcely been investigated. Here, we study the associations between nearby residential green space and residential indoor microbiota. Methods: We collected settled dust from 176 living rooms of participants of the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing, and quantitative PCR measurements of total bacterial and fungal loads to calculate bacterial and fungal diversity measures (Chao1 richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices) and relative abundance of individual taxa. Green spaces were estimated within 50m and 100m buffers around the residential address. We defined total residential green space using high-resolution land-cover data, further stratified in low-growing (height{\textless}3m) and high-growing green (height{\textgreater}3m). We used land-use data to calculate the residential nature. We ran linear regression models, adjusting for confounders and other potential determinants. Results are expressed as units change for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in residential green space and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). Results: After adjustment, we observed statistically significant associations between the indoor microbial diversity indices and nearby residential green space. For bacteria, the Shannon index was directly associated with residential nature (e.g. 0.08 units increase (CI:0.02,0.13) per IQR increase in nature within a 50m buffer). Fungal diversity was directly associated with high-growing residential green and inversely with low-growing green. For example, an IQR increase in high-growing green within a 50m buffer was associated with increases in 0.14 (CI:0.01,0.27) and 0.02 (CI:0.008,0.04) units in the Shannon and Simpson indices, respectively. Conclusions: Nearby green space determines the diversity of indoor environment microbiota, and the type of green differently impacts bacterial and fungal diversity. Further research is needed to investigate in more detail possible microbial taxa compositions underlying the observed changes in indoor microbiota diversity and to explore their contribution to beneficial health effects associated with green space exposure.},

We aimed to determine whether the indoor microbial diversity at early-life is associated with the development of allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy. Methods: The study population included children within two birth cohorts: Finnish rural-suburban LUKAS (N = 312), and German urban LISA from Munich and Leipzig study centers (N = 248). The indoor microbiota diversity (Chao1 richness and Shannon entropy) was characterized from floor dust samples collected at the child age of 2–3 months by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial and fungal DNA amplicons. Allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy were determined at the age of 10 years and analyzed using logistic regression models. Results: High bacterial richness (aOR 0.19, 95{\%}CI 0.09–0.42 for middle and aOR 0.12, 95{\%}CI 0.05–0.29 for highest vs. lowest tertile) and Shannon entropy were associated with lower risk of allergic rhinitis in LISA, and similar trend was seen in LUKAS. We observed some significant associations between bacterial and fungal diversity measured and the risk of inhalant atopy, but the associations were inconsistent between the two cohorts. High bacterial diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy in rural areas, but lower risk in more urban areas. Fungal diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy only in LISA. Conclusions: Our study suggests that a higher bacterial diversity may reduce the risk of allergic rhinitis later in childhood. The environment-dependent heterogeneity in the associations with inhalant atopy – visible here as inconsistent results between two differing cohorts - suggests that specific constituents of the diversity may be relevant.},

abstract = {Background: The microbiome of the home is of great interest because of its possible impact on health. Our goal was to identify some of the factors that determine the richness, evenness and diversity of the home's fungal and bacterial microbiomes. Method: Vacuumed settled dust from homes (n=35) in Cincinnati, OH, were analyzed by pyrosequencing to determine the fungal and bacterial relative sequence occurrence. The correlation coefficients between home environmental characteristics, including age of home, Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values, occupant number, relative humidity and temperature, as well as pets (dog and cat) were evaluated for their influence on fungal and bacterial communities. In addition, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for identifying fungal and bacterial genera and species associated with those housing determinants found to be significant. Results: The fungal richness was found to be positively correlated with age of home (p=0.002), ERMI value (p=0.003), and relative humidity (p=0.015) in the home. However, fungal evenness and diversity were only correlated with the age of home (p=0.001). Diversity and evenness (not richness) of the bacterial microbiome in the homes were associated with dog ownership.Linear discriminant analysis showed total of 39 putative fungal genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in high ERMI homes and 47 genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in homes with high relative humidity. When categorized according to the age of the home, a total of 67 fungal genera/species had LDA scores above the significance threshold. Dog ownership appeared to have the most influence on the bacterial microbiome, since a total of 130 bacterial genera/species had significantly higher LDA scores in homes with dogs. Conclusions: Some key determinants of the fungal and bacterial microbiome appear to be excess moisture, age of the home and dog ownership.},

This community develops in infancy, and its composition is strongly influenced by environmental factors, notably perinatal anthropogenic exposures such as delivery mode (Cesarean vs. vaginal) and feeding method (breast vs. formula); however, the built environment as a possible source of exposure has not been considered. Here we report on a preliminary investigation of the associations between bacteria in house dust and the nascent fecal microbiota from 20 subjects from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study using high-throughput sequence analysis of portions of the 16S rRNA gene. Despite significant differences between the dust and fecal microbiota revealed by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis, permutation analysis confirmed that 14 bacterial OTUs representing the classes Actinobacteria (3), Bacilli (3), Clostridia (6) and Gammaproteobacteria (2) co-occurred at a significantly higher frequency in matched dust-stool pairs than in randomly permuted pairs, indicating an association between these dust and stool communities. These associations could indicate a role for the indoor environment in shaping the nascent gut microbiota, but future studies will be needed to confirm that our findings do not solely reflect a reverse pathway. Although pet ownership was strongly associated with the presence of certain genera in the dust for dogs (Agrococcus, Carnobacterium, Exiguobacterium, Herbaspirillum, Leifsonia and Neisseria) and cats (Escherichia), no clear patterns were observed in the NMDS-resolved stool community profiles as a function of pet ownership. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We aimed to study the relationship between the indoor airborne dust bacterial and fungal microbiota and childhood LRTI in Ibadan, Nigeria. Ninety-eight children under the age of five years hospitalized with LRTI were recruited and matched by age (±3 months), sex, and geographical location to 99 community-based controls without LRTI. Participants' homes were visited and sampled over a 14-day period for airborne house dust using electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDC). In airborne dust samples, the composition of bacterial and fungal communities was characterized by a meta-barcoding approach using amplicons targeting simultaneously the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the internal-transcribed-spacer (ITS) region-1 of fungi in association with the SILVA and UNITE database respectively. A 100-unit change in house dust bacterial, but not fungal, richness (OR 1.06; 95{\%}CI 1.03–1.10) and a 1-unit change in Shannon diversity (OR 1.92; 95{\%}CI 1.28–3.01) were both independently associated with childhood LRTI after adjusting for other indoor environmental risk factors. Beta-diversity analysis showed that bacterial (PERMANOVA p {\textless} 0.001, R2 = 0.036) and fungal (PERMANOVA p {\textless} 0.001, R2 = 0.028) community composition differed significantly between homes of cases and controls. Pair-wise differential abundance analysis using both DESEq2 and MaAsLin2 consistently identified the bacterial phyla Deinococcota (Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted p-value {\textless}0.001) and Bacteriodota (BH-adjusted p-value = 0.004) to be negatively associated with LRTI. Within the fungal microbiota, phylum Ascomycota abundance (BH adjusted p-value {\textless}0.001) was observed to be directly associated with LRTI, while Basidiomycota abundance (BH adjusted p-value {\textless}0.001) was negatively associated with LRTI. Our study suggests that early-life exposure to certain airborne bacterial and fungal communities is associated with LRTI among children under the age of five years.},

abstract = {Background: Farm work entails a heterogeneous mixture of exposures that vary considerably across farms and farmers. Farm work is associated with various health outcomes, both adverse and beneficial. One mechanism by which farming exposures can impact health is through the microbiome, including the indoor home environment microbiome. It is unknown how individual occupational exposures shape the microbial composition in workers' homes. Objectives: We investigated associations between farm work activities, including specific tasks and pesticide use, and the indoor microbiome in the homes of 468 male farmers. Methods: Participants were licensed pesticide applicators, mostly farmers, enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study from 2008 to 2011. Vacuumed dust from participants' bedrooms underwent whole-genome shotgun sequencing for indoor microbiome assessment. Using questionnaire data, we evaluated 6 farm work tasks (processing of either hay, silage, animal feed, fertilizer, or soy/grains, and cleaning grain bins) and 19 pesticide ingredients currently used in the past year, plus 7 banned persistent pesticide ingredients ever used. Results: All 6 work tasks were associated with increased microbial diversity levels, with a positive dose-response for the total number of tasks performed (P = 0.001). All tasks were associated with altered microbial compositions (weighted UniFrac P = 0.001) and with higher abundance of specific microbes, including soil-based commensal microbes such as Haloterrigena. Among the 19 pesticides, current use of glyphosate and past use of lindane were associated with increased microbial diversity (P = 0.02–0.04). Ten currently used pesticides and all 7 banned pesticides were associated with altered microbial composition (P = 0.001–0.04). Six pesticides were associated with differential abundance of certain microbes. Discussion: Different farm activities and exposures can uniquely impact the dust microbiome inside homes. Our work suggests that changes to the home microbiome could serve as one pathway for how occupational exposures impact the health of workers and their cohabitating family members, offering possible future intervention targets.},

abstract = {University students are constantly exposed to potential bacterial pathogens and environmental pollutants in indoor environment because they spend most of their time indoors. University dormitory and printing shop are two typical indoor environments frequented by university students. However, little is known about the characteristics of bacterial community as well as the effect of indoor environmental factors on them. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal the bacterial community in indoor dust, electronic devices were recorded during dust sampling, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were leading phyla, and Acinetobacter, Paracoccus and Kocuria were dominating genera. The predominant genera showed Acinetobacter {\textgreater} Paracoccus {\textgreater} unidentified Corynebacteriaceae in indoor dusts from university dormitories, whereas Paracoccus {\textgreater} unidentified Cyanobacteria {\textgreater} Acinetobacter in printing shops. The occurrence of Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus suggested the health risks of potential pathogenic bacteria to university students. Significant differences of microbial composition and diversity were proved between university dormitories and printing shops. Chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were dominant bacterial functions, and the seven primary bacterial functions displayed university dormitory {\textgreater} printing shop. BDE 138 and BDE 66 were main environmental parameters affecting the indoor dust bacterial community in university dormitory, while printer and BDE 47 played dominating role in shaping microorganism in printing shop. The complex biotic (potential bacterial pathogens) and abiotic factors (electronic equipment and chemical pollutants) in indoor dusts may pose potential health risks to university students.},

abstract = {The importance of the microbial diversity of bioaerosols in relation to occupational exposure and work related health symptoms is not known. The aim of this paper is to gain knowledge on the bacterial and fungal communities in dust causing organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) and in reference dust not causing ODTS. Bacterial and fungal communities were described in personal exposure samples from grass seed workers developing ODTS, in dust generated from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust generated from reference seeds not causing ODTS. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region, as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) were used for identification of fungi and bacteria in personal exposure samples and in dust samples from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust from reference grass seeds. Furthermore, activities of enzymes were measured in the same samples.The sequencing data revealed more than 150 bacterial and 25 fungal genera present in each sample. Streptomyces spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus microsporus were dominating in the dust causing ODTS but not in the reference dust. The dustiness in terms of Mucor sp. and R. microsporus were 100-1000 times higher for problematic seeds compared to reference seeds. The bacterial species in the dust causing ODTS included pathogenic species such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Streptomyces pneumonia, and it contained increased concentrations of total protein, serine protease, chitinase, and $\beta$-glucosidase. Twenty-three bacterial genera covered more than 50{\%} of the total reads in the personal and problematic seed dust. These 23 genera accounted for less than 7{\%} of the total reads in the reference seed dust. The microbial community of the dust from the problematic seeds showed great similarities to that from the personal air samples from the workers. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time a shift in the microbial community in aerosol samples that caused ODTS compared to the reference samples that did not cause the ODTS. Furthermore, elevated enzyme activities were found in the dust causing ODTS.},

However, the ARGs harbored by EVs in ambient environments and the transfer potential are still unclear. In this study, the prevalence of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in EVs and their microbial origins were studied in indoor dust from restaurants, kindergarten, dormitories, and vehicles. The amount of EVs ranged from 3.40 × 107to 1.09 × 1011particles/g dust. The length of EV-associated DNA fragments was between 21 bp and 9.7 kb. Metagenomic sequencing showed that a total of 241 antibiotic ARG subtypes encoding resistance to 16 common classes were detected in the EVs from all four fields. Multidrug, quinolone, and macrolide resistance genes were the dominant types. 15 ARG subtypes were exclusively carried and even enriched in EVs compared to the indoor microbiome. Moreover, several ARGs showed co-occurrence with MGEs. The EVs showed distinct taxonomic composition with their original dust microbiota. 30.23{\%} of EV-associated DNA was predicted to originate from potential pathogens. Our results indicated the widespread of EVs carrying ARGs and virulence genes in daily life indoor dust, provided new insights into the status of extracellular DNA, and raised risk concerns on their gene transfer potential.},

abstract = {Microorganisms residing in the human respiratory tract can be exhaled, and they constitute a part of environmental microbiotas. However, the expiratory microbiota community and its associations with environmental microbiotas remain poorly understood. Here, expiratory bacteria and fungi and the corresponding microbiotas from the living environments were characterized by DNA amplicon sequencing of residents' exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and environmental samples collected from 14 residences in Nanjing, China. The microbiotas of EBC samples, with a substantial heterogeneity, were found to be as diverse as those of skin, floor dust, and airborne microbiotas. Model fitting results demonstrated the role of stochastic processes in the assembly of the expiratory microbiota. Using a fast expectation-maximization algorithm, microbial community analysis revealed that expiratory microbiotas were differentially associated with other types of microbiotas in a type-dependent and residence-specific manner. Importantly, the expiratory bacteria showed a composition similarity with airborne bacteria in the bathroom and kitchen environments with an average of 12.60{\%}, while the expiratory fungi showed a 53.99{\%} composition similarity with the floor dust fungi. These differential patterns indicate different relationships between expiratory microbiotas and the airborne microbiotas and floor dust microbiotas. The results here illustrated for the first time the associations between expiratory microbiotas and indoor microbiotas, showing a potential microbial exchange between the respiratory tract and indoor environment. Thus, improved hygiene and ventilation practices can be implemented to optimize the indoor microbial exposome, especially in indoor bathrooms and kitchens.},

Using culture-independent approaches, we characterized bacterial and fungal communities in homes in Boulder, CO, USA 2-3 months after the historic September, 2013 flooding event. We collected passive air samples from basements in 50 homes (36 flood-damaged, 14 non-flooded), and we sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4-V5 region) and the fungal ITS1 region from these samples for community analyses. Quantitative PCR was used to estimate the abundances of bacteria and fungi in the passive air samples. Results indicate significant differences in bacterial and fungal community composition between flooded and non-flooded homes. Fungal abundances were estimated to be three times higher in flooded, relative to non-flooded homes, but there were no significant differences in bacterial abundances. Penicillium (fungi) and Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae (bacteria) were among the most abundant taxa in flooded homes. Our results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities continue to be affected by flooding, even after relative humidity has returned to baseline levels and remediation has removed any visible evidence of flood damage.},

This study investigated the airborne microbiomes in the homes of 1038 participants from five cities in Northern Europe: Aarhus, Bergen, Reykjavik, Tartu, and Uppsala. Airborne dust particles were sampled with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs) from the participants' bedrooms. The dust washed from the EDCs' clothes was used to extract DNA and endotoxin. The DNA extracts were used for quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) measurement and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while endotoxin was measured using the kinetic chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. The results showed that households in Tartu and Aarhus had a higher bacterial load and diversity than those in Bergen and Reykjavik, possibly due to elevated concentrations of outdoor bacterial taxa associated with low precipitation and high wind speeds. Bergen-Tartu had the highest difference (ANOSIM R = 0.203) in $\beta$ diversity. Multivariate regression models showed that $\alpha$ diversity indices and bacterial and endotoxin loads were positively associated with the occupants' age, number of occupants, cleaning frequency, presence of dogs, and age of the house. Further studies are needed to understand how meteorological factors influence the indoor bacterial community in light of climate change.},

Although microplastics (MPs) are distributed in indoor environments in high abundance, information on the effect of MPs on a microbial community in an indoor environment is lacking. Here, we detected polymers (containing MPs and natural polymers), bacterial communities, and 18 kinds of ARGs in collected indoor dust samples. A significant correlation by Procrustes analysis between bacterial community composition and the abundance of MPs was observed, and correlation tests and redundancy analysis identified specific associations between MP polymers and bacterial taxa, such as polyamide and Actinobacteria. In addition, the abundance of MPs showed a positive correlation with the relative abundance of the ARGs (to 16S RNA), while natural polymers, such as cellulosics, showed positive correlations with the absolute abundance of ARGs and 16S rRNA. Simulated experiments verified that significantly higher bacterial biomasses and ARGs were observed on the surface of cotton, hair, and wool than on MPs, while a higher relative abundance of ARGs was detected on MPs. However, a significantly higher amount of ARG was found on MPs of poly(lactic acid), the biodegradable plastics with the highest yield. In addition to the plastisphere in water and soil environments, MPs in an indoor environment may also affect the bacterial community and specifically enrich ARGs. Moreover, degradable MPs and nondegradable MPs may result in different health hazards due to their distinct effects on bacterial community.},

Here, we explore the relationship between antibiotic resistance genes and the antimicrobial chemicals triclosan, triclocarban, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben in the dust microbiome. Dust samples from a mixed-use athletic and educational facility were subjected to microbial and chemical analyses using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The dust resistome was characterized by identifying antibiotic resistance genes annotated in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) from the metagenomes of each sample using the Short, Better Representative Extract Data set (ShortBRED). The three most highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes were tet(W), blaSRT-1, and erm(B). The complete dust resistome was then compared against the measured concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals, which for triclosan ranged from 0.5 to 1970 ng/g dust. We observed six significant positive associations between the concentration of an antimicrobial chemical and the relative abundance of an antibiotic resistance gene, including one between the ubiquitous antimicrobial triclosan and erm(X), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase implicated in resistance to several antibiotics. This study is the first to look for an association between antibiotic resistance genes and antimicrobial chemicals in dust.},

abstract = {Background Indoor microbial exposure is associated with asthma, but the health effects of indoor metabolites and chemicals have not been comprehensively assessed. Methods We collected classroom dust from 24 junior high schools in three geographically distanced areas in Malaysia (Johor Bahru, Terengganu and Penang), and conducted culture-independent high-throughput microbiome and untargeted metabolomics/chemical profiling. Results 1290 students were surveyed for asthma symptoms (wheeze). In each centre, we found significant variation in the prevalence of wheeze among schools, which could be explained by personal characteristics and air pollutants. Large-scale microbial variations were observed between the three centres; the potential protective bacteria were mainly from phyla Actinobacteria in Johor Bahru, Cyanobacteria in Terengganu and Proteobacteria in Penang. In total, 2633 metabolites and chemicals were characterised. Many metabolites were enriched in low-wheeze schools, including plant secondary metabolites flavonoids/isoflavonoids (isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, astragalin), indole and derivatives (indole, serotonin, 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde), and others (biotin, chavicol). A neural network analysis showed that the indole derivatives were co-occurring with the potential protective microbial taxa, including Actinomycetospora, Fischerella and Truepera, suggesting these microorganisms may pose health effects by releasing indole metabolites. A few synthetic chemicals were enriched in high-wheeze schools, including pesticides (2 (3H)-benzothiazolethione), fragrances (2-aminobenzoic acid, isovaleric acid), detergents and plastics (phthalic acid), and industrial materials (4,4-sulfonyldiphenol). Conclusions This is the first association study between high-throughput indoor chemical profiling and asthma symptoms. The consistent results from the three centres indicate that indoor metabolites/chemicals could be a better indicator than the indoor microbiome for environmental and health assessments, providing new insights for asthma prediction, prevention and control.},

abstract = {The microbial communities on shoe soles and shoeprints could carry microbial information about where someone walked. This is possible evidence to link a suspect in a crime case to a geographic location. A previous study had shown that the microbiota found on shoe soles depend on the microbiota of the soil on which people walk. However, there is a turnover of microbial communities on shoe soles during walking. The impact of microbial community turnover on tracing recent geolocation from shoe soles has not been adequately studied. In addition, it is still unclear whether the microbiota of shoeprints can be used to determine recent geolocation. In this preliminary study, we investigated whether the microbial characteristics of shoe soles and shoeprints can be used to trace geolocation and whether this information can be destroyed by walking on indoor floors. In this study, participants were asked to walk outdoors on exposed soil, then walk indoors on a hard wood floor. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to characterize the microbial communities of shoe soles, shoeprints, indoor dust, and outdoor soil. Samples of shoe soles and shoeprints were collected at steps 5, 20, and 50 while walking indoors. The PCoA result showed that the samples were clustered by geographic origin. The shoeprint showed a more rapid turnover of microbial community than the shoe sole during indoor walking. The result of FEAST showed that the microbial communities of shoe sole and shoeprint were mainly (shoe sole, 86.21∼92.34 {\%}; shoeprint, 61.66∼90.41 {\%}) from the soil of the outdoor ground where the individual recently walked, and a small portion (shoe sole, 0.68∼3.33 {\%}; shoeprint, 1.43∼27.14 {\%}) from the indoor dust. Based on the matching of microbial communities between geolocation and shoe sole or shoeprint, we were able to infer the recent geolocation of the individual with relatively high accuracy using the random forest prediction model (shoe sole: 100.00 {\%}, shoeprint: 93.33∼100.00 {\%}). Overall, we are able to accurately infer the geolocation of an individual's most recent outdoor walk based on the microbiota of shoe sole and shoeprint, even though these microbiotas show a turnover when walking indoor floor. The pilot study was expected to provide a potential method for tracing recent geolocation of suspects.},

abstract = {Our indoor microbiome consists of a wide range of microbial taxa. Whilst many of these microbes are benign, some are beneficial, some harmful, yet our knowledge of the spatial heterogeneity of bacterial assemblages in our residential environment remains limited. To investigate the existence of a common core house dust bacterial microbiome we selected household vacuum dusts, collected through a citizen science approach, from homes across two bioclimatic regions (UK, Oceanic/Maritime and Greece, Mediterranean). Following the extraction of DNA from each dust sample, we targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina NextSeq sequencing. PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial communities at family level grouped samples within their distinct bioclimatic region and SIMPER analysis at genus level identified the statistically significant taxa responsible for driving diversity between these groups. A “common to all” core house dust microbiome consisted of Acinetobacter , Massalia, Rubellimicrobium, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus ; genera typically associated with human occupancy and common environmental sources. Additionally, a “unique location specific” microbiome was identified, reflective of the bioclimatic region. The Greek dusts indicated a lower average diversity than the UK house dusts, with a high abundance of Rhizobiaceae in the Greek samples. Our study highlights citizen science as a powerful approach to access the indoor residential environment, at scale, and establishes the existence of a “core” house dust microbiome independent of bioclimatic region.},

abstract = {The indoors is where many humans spend most of their time, and are strongly exposed to indoor microbiota, which may have multifaceted effects on health. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of indoor microbiota is necessary. We collected dust samples from 295 homes of families with young children in the Helsinki region of Finland and analyzed the bacterial and fungal composition based on the 16S rRNA and ITS DNA sequences. Microbial profiles were combined with extensive survey data on family structure, daily life, and physical characteristics of the home, as well as additional external environmental information, such as land use, and vegetational biodiversity near the home. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance we explained 18{\%} of the variation of the relative abundance between samples within bacterial composition, and 17{\%} of the fungal composition with the explanatory variables. The fungal community was dominated by the phyla Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota; the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were dominant. The presence of dogs, multiple children, and firewood were significantly associated with both the fungal and bacterial composition. Additionally, fungal communities were associated with land use, biodiversity in the area, and the type of building, while bacterial communities were associated with the human inhabitants and cleaning practices. A distinction emerged between members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, Ascomycota being more abundant in homes with greater surrounding natural environment, and potential contact with the environment. The results suggest that the fungal composition is strongly dependent on the transport of outdoor environmental fungi into homes, while bacteria are largely derived from the inhabitants.},

abstract = {Background: The exposure of house occupants to indoor air pollutants has increased in recent decades. Among microbiological contaminants, bacterial and fungal aerosols remain poorly studied and the debate on the impact of these aerosols on respiratory health is still open. This study aimed to assess the diversity of indoor microbial communities in relationship with the health of occupants. Methods: Measurements were taken from dwellings of 2 cohorts in Brittany (France), one with children without any pathology and the other with children and adults with asthma. Thirty dust samples were analyzed by next generation sequencing with a 16S and 18S targeted metagenomics approach. Analysis of sequencing data was performed using qiime 2, and univariate and multivariate statistical analysis using R software and phyloseq package. Results: A total of 2,637 prokaryotic (589 at genus level) and 2,153 eukaryotic taxa were identified (856 fungal taxa (39{\%}) and 573 metazoa (26{\%})). The four main bacterial phyla were identified: Proteobacteria (53{\%}), Firmicutes (27{\%}), Actinobacteria (11{\%}), Bacteroidetes (8{\%}). Among Fungi, only 136 taxa were identified at genus level. Three main fungal phyla were identified: Ascomycota (84{\%}), Basidiomycota (12{\%}) and Mucoromycota (3{\%}). No bacterial nor fungal phyla were significantly associated with asthma versus control group. A significant over representation in control group versus asthma was observed for Christensenellaceae family (p-value = 0.0015, adj. p-value = 0.033). Besides, a trend for over representation in control group was observed with Dermabacteraceae family (p-value = 0.0002, adj. p-value = 0.815). Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that dust samples harbor a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and fungi. Molecular methods such as next generation sequencing are reliable tools for identifying and tracking the bacterial and fungal diversity in dust samples, a less easy strategy for the detection of eukaryotes at least using18S metagenomics approach. This study showed that the detection of some bacteria might be associated to indoor air of asthmatic patients. Regarding fungi, a higher number of samples and sequencing with more depth could allow reaching significant signatures.},

abstract = {Indoor home dust microbial communities, important contributors to human health, are shaped by environmental factors, including farm-related exposures. Advanced metagenomic whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) improves detection and characterization of microbiota in the indoor built-environment dust microbiome, compared to conventional 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (16S). We hypothesized that the improved characterization of indoor dust microbial communities by WGS will enhance detection of exposure-outcome associations. The objective of this study was to identify novel associations of environmental exposures with the dust microbiome from the homes of 781 farmers and farm spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study. We examined various farm-related exposures, including living on a farm, crop versus animal production, and type of animal production, as well as non-farm exposures, including home cleanliness and indoor pets. We assessed the association of the exposures on within-sample alpha diversity and between-sample beta diversity, and the differential abundance of specific microbes by exposure. Results were compared to previous findings using 16S. We found most farm exposures were significantly positively associated with both alpha and beta diversity. Many microbes exhibited differential abundance related to farm exposures, mainly in the phyla Actinobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria . The identification of novel differential taxa associated with farming at the genera level, including Rhodococcus , Bifidobacterium , Corynebacterium , and Pseudomonas , was a benefit of WGS compared to 16S. Our findings indicate that characterization of dust microbiota, an important component of the indoor environment relevant to human health, is heavily influenced by sequencing techniques. WGS is a powerful tool to survey the microbial community that provides novel insights on the impact of environmental exposures on indoor dust microbiota. These findings can inform the design of future studies in environmental health.},

abstract = {Living on a farm has been linked to a lower risk of immunoregulatory disorders, such as asthma, allergy, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is hypothesized that a decrease in the diversity and composition of indoor microbial communities is a sensible explanation for the upsurge in immunoregulatory diseases, with airborne bacteria contributing to this protective effect. However, the composition of this potentially beneficial microbial community in various farm and suburban indoor environments is still to be characterized. We collected settled airborne dust from stables and the associated farmers' homes and from suburban homes using electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) over a period of 14 days. Then, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to assess bacterial abundance. The V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Ilumina MiSeq in order to assess microbial diversity. The Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2) algorithm was used for the inference of amplicon sequence variants from amplicon data. Airborne bacteria were significantly more abundant in farmers' indoor environments than in suburban homes ( p {\textless} 0.001). Cow farmers' homes had significantly higher bacterial diversity than pig farmers' and suburban homes ( p {\textless} 0.001). Bacterial taxa, such as Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Lactobacillus were significantly more abundant in farmers' homes than suburban homes, and the same was true for beneficial intestinal bacterial species, such as Lactobacillus amylovorus , Eubacterium hallii , and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii . Furthermore, we found a higher similarity between bacterial communities in individual farmers' homes and their associated cow stables than for pig stables. Our findings contribute with important knowledge on bacterial composition, abundance, and diversity in different environments, which is highly valuable in the discussion on how microbial exposure may contribute to the development of immune-mediated diseases in both children and adults.},

abstract = {Airborne bacterial communities are subject to conditions ill-suited to microbial activity and growth. In spite of this, air is an important transfer medium for bacteria, with the bacteria in indoor air having potentially major consequences for the health of a building's occupants. A major example is the decreased diversity and altered composition of indoor airborne microbial communities as a proposed explanation for the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies worldwide. Previous research has shown that living on a farm confers protection against development of asthma and allergies, with airborne bacteria suggested as playing a role in this protective effect. However, the composition of this beneficial microbial community has still not been identified. We sampled settled airborne dust using a passive dust sampler from Danish pig stables, associated farmers' homes, and from suburban homes (267 samples in total) and carried out quantitative PCR measurements of bacterial abundance and MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes found in these samples. Airborne bacteria had a greater diversity and were significantly more abundant in pig stables and farmers' homes than suburban homes (Wilcoxon rank sum test P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, bacterial taxa previously suggested to contribute to a protective effect had significantly higher relative and absolute abundance in pig stables and farmers' homes than in suburban homes (ALDEx2 with P {\textless} 0.05), including Firmicutes, Peptostreptococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminiclostridium, and Lactobacillus. Pig stables had significantly lower airborne bacterial diversity than farmers' homes, and there was no discernable direct transfer of airborne bacteria from stable to home. This study identifies differences in indoor airborne bacterial communities that may be an important component of this putative protective effect, while showing that pig stables themselves do not appear to directly contribute to the airborne bacterial communities in the homes of farmers. These findings improve our understanding of the role of airborne bacteria in the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergy.},

abstract = {Rural environments and microbiota are linked to a reduction in the prevalence of allergies. However, the mechanism underlying the reduced allergies modulated by rural residency is unclear. Here, we assessed gut bacterial composition and metagenomics in urban and rural children in the EuroPrevall-INCO cohort. Airborne dusts, including mattress and rural henhouse dusts, were profiled for bacterial and fungal composition by amplicon sequencing. Mice were repeatedly exposed to intranasal dust extracts and evaluated for their effects on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation, and gut microbiota restoration was validated by fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from dust-exposed donor mice. We found that rural children had fewer allergies and unique gut microbiota with fewer Bacteroides and more Prevotella. Indoor dusts in rural environments harbored higher endotoxin level and diversity of bacteria and fungi, whereas indoor urban dusts were enriched with Aspergillus and contained elevated pathogenic bacteria. Intranasal administration of rural dusts before OVA sensitization reduced respiratory eosinophils and blood IgE level in mice and also led to a recovery of gut bacterial diversity and Ruminiclostridium in the mouse model. FMT restored the protective effect by reducing OVA-induced lung eosinophils in recipient mice. Together, these results support a cause-effect relationship between exposure to dust microbiota and allergy susceptibility in children and mice. Specifically, rural environmental exposure modulated the gut microbiota, which was essential in reducing allergy in children from Southern China. Our findings support the notion that the modulation of gut microbiota by exposure to rural indoor dust may improve allergy prevention.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Biocides are used ubiquitously in indoor environments, but knowledge is limited about how they impact indoor bacterial compositions and diversities. In this study, an in vitro experiment was conducted to demonstrate changes in the culturable house dust-borne bacterial compositions and diversities by exposures to three biocides of CuSO4 (CUS), triclosan (TRC), or benzalkonium chloride with respective concentrations of 90, 45, and 0.1 $\mu$g ml−1. The high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial compositions and diversities. The $\alpha$ diversity analysis showed reductions in the species richness and evenness by exposures to CUS and TRC (p {\textless} 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank tests). The $\beta$ diversity analysis revealed the significant changes in the community memberships for CUS and TRC (p {\textless} 0.05, P-tests based on the Jaccard indices), which were thought due to selective bacterial inhibitions. The taxonomic analysis found the inhibitions of Enterococcus, Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia,Clostridium sensu stricto, and Stenotrophomonas. The findings of the present in vitro study provide important insights into how use of biocides in indoor environments affects bacterial compositions and diversities. Future in situ research is warranted to confirm how they impact indoor microbial compositions and diversities, which are thought to be important for human health.},

abstract = {Building professionals are increasingly being called upon to conduct indoor microbial investigations as they remediate moisture-damaged buildings and design new, healthy, sustainable buildings. Characterizing the indoor microbial community present in the built environment is challenging and complicated by the vast array of biological methods available to building professionals. Furthermore, the particular biological technique employed to study an indoor environment can have a significant impact on the results obtained. This study evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of four biological methods suitable for indoor microbial investigations: culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Sanger sequencing, and pyrosequencing. The results obtained from a study of four buildings are used to evaluate the merits of each bioanalytical approach. In each of the four study sites, the microbial-laden dust recovered on HVAC filters was used to provide a passive, long-term sample of the indoor air. Culturing of the microorganisms recovered from the dust was the least expensive method tested but provided a limited characterization of the microbial community present. qPCR provided the most specific information about the presence and quantity of target microorganisms but this method requires a priori knowledge of the species of interest and specifically designed primers that may not enumerate unanticipated species. Sanger sequencing provided microbial identification at the species level but lacked coverage to fully describe the microbial community present. Pyrosequencing provided in-depth sequence coverage of the microbial community present (to the genus level) but the vast dataset generated required increased computational analysis and data storage. Nevertheless, pyrosequencing when coupled with qPCR for target species quantification represents a viable approach that should become more accessible to building professionals as user-friendly software for analyzing sequencing results becomes available and more commercial laboratories offer these services. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Due to the limitations of epidemiological surveys, the actual fungal exposure characteristics in residences has not been sufficiently understood. This study aimed to characterize household fungal diversity and its annual temporal and spatial variations. We developed combined cross-sectional survey, repeated air sampling around a year, and DNA sequencing methods. The questionnaire survey was conducted in 2019, and 4943 valid cases were received from parents; a follow-up case–control study (11 cases and 12 controls) was designed, and onsite measurements of indoor environments were repeated in typical summer, transient season, and winter; dust from floor and beddings in children's room were collected and ITS based DNA sequencing of totally 68 samples was conducted. Results from 3361 children without changes to their residences since birth verified the significant associations of indoor dampness/mold indicators and prevalence of children-reported diseases, with increased adjusted odd ratios (aORs) {\textgreater}1 for studied asthma, wheeze, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. The airborne fungal concentrations from air sampling were higher than 1000 CFU/m3 in summer, regardless of indoors and outdoors, indicating an intermediate pollution level. The DNA sequencing for dust showed the Aspergillus was the predominant at genus level and the Aspergillus{\_}penicillioides was the most common at species level; while the fungal community and composition varied significantly in different homes and seasons, according to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity analyses. The comprehensive research methods contribute to a holistic understanding of indoor fungal exposure, including the concentrations, seasonal variations, community, and diversity, and verifies the relations with children's adverse health outcomes. The study further elucidates the role of microbiome in human health, which helps setting health-protective thresholds and managing mold treatments in buildings, to promote indoor air quality and human well-beings.},

We analyzed the samples using 16s bacterial rDNA and ITS fungal rDNA gene sequencing, as well as quantitative PCR with universal fungal and bacterial primers. Results showed that home dust had the greatest alpha diversity between the three sample types for both bacteria and fungi. Dust had the highest total fungal load and the lowest total bacterial load. Sputum had greater bacterial diversity than saliva, but saliva had greater fungal diversity than sputum. The distribution of major bacterial phyla differed between all sample types. However, the distribution of major fungal classes differed only between sputum and saliva. Future research should examine the biological significance of the taxa found in each sample type based on microbial ecology and associations with health effects.},

Finally, we explored whether exposure to specific taxa within the indoor microbiota may explain the association between moisture damage and respiratory health. Schools were assessed for moisture damage through detailed inspections, and the microbial composition of settled dust in electrostatic dustfall collectors was determined using marker-gene analysis. In Finland, there were several positive associations between particular microbial indicators (diversity, richness, individual taxa) and a respiratory symptom score, while in the Netherlands, the associations tended to be mostly inverse and statistically non-significant. In Finland, abundance of the Sphingomonas bacterial genus and endotoxin levels partially explained the associations between moisture damage and symptom score. A few microbial taxa explained part of the associations with health, but overall, the observed associations between damage-associated individual taxa and respiratory health were limited.},

abstract = {Recent studies reveal that the microbial diversity and composition in the respiratory tract are related to the susceptibility, development, and progression of respiratory infections. Indoor microorganisms can transmit into the respiratory tract through breathing, but their role in infections is unclear. Here, we present the first association study between the indoor microbiome and respiratory infections. In total, 357 students living in 86 dormitory rooms in Shanxi University were randomly selected to survey symptoms of infections. Settled air dust was collected to characterize bacterial compositions by 16S rRNA sequencing. The overall microbial richness was not associated with respiratory infections, but microorganisms from specific phylogenetic classes showed various associations. Taxa richness and abundance of Actinobacteria were protectively associated with infections (P {\textless}.05). The abundance of several genera in Gammaproteobacteria, including Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Buttiauxella, and Raoultella, was positively associated with infections (P {\textless}.005). The role of these microorganisms was consistent with previous human microbiota studies. Building age was associated with the overall microbial composition variation in dormitories and negatively associated with three potential risk genera in Proteobacteria (P {\textless}.05). The weight of vacuum dust was positively associated with a protective genus, Micrococcus in Actinobacteria (P {\textless}.05).},

The goal was to investigate whether introducing a dog into the home changes the home dust microbiota. Families without dogs or cats planning to adopt a dog and those who were not were recruited. Dust samples were collected from the homes at recruitment and 12 months later. Microbiota composition and taxa (V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) were compared between homes that did and did not adopt a dog. A total of 91 dust samples from 54 families (27 each, dog and no dog; 17 dog and 20 no dog homes with paired samples) were analyzed. A significant dog effect was seen across time in both unweighted UniFrac and Canberra metrics (both P =.008), indicating dog introduction may result in rapid establishment of rarer and phylogenetically related taxa. A significant dog-time interaction was seen in both weighted UniFrac (P {\textless}.001) and Bray-Curtis (P =.002) metrics, suggesting that while there may not initially be large relative abundance shifts following dog introduction, differences can be seen within a year. Therefore, dog introduction into the home has both immediate effects and effects that emerge over time.},

The goal of this study was to characterize microbial growth in floor dust at variable equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) levels. Floor dust from one home was embedded in coupons cut from a worn medium-pile nylon carpet and incubated at 50{\%}, 80{\%}, 85{\%}, 90{\%}, 95{\%}, and 100{\%} ERH levels. Quantitative PCR and DNA sequencing of ribosomal DNA for bacteria and fungi were used to quantify growth and community shifts. Over a 1-wk period, fungal growth occurred above 80{\%} ERH. Growth rates at 85{\%} and 100{\%} ERH were 1.1 × 104 and 1.5 × 105 spore equivalents d−1 mg dust−1, respectively. Bacterial growth occurred only at 100{\%} ERH after 1 wk (9.0 × 104 genomes d−1 mg dust−1). Growth resulted in significant changes in fungal (P{\textless}.00001) and bacterial community structure (P{\textless}.00001) at varying ERH levels. Comparisons between fungal taxa incubated at different ERH levels revealed more than 100 fungal and bacterial species that were attributable to elevated ERH. Resuspension modeling indicated that more than 50{\%} of airborne microbes could originate from the resuspension of fungi grown at ERH levels of 85{\%} and above.},

The sex of the room occupants had the most significant effect on the bacterial communities, while the room occupants had no significant effect on fungal communities. By examining the abundances of bacterial genera, we could predict the sex of room occupants with 79{\%} accuracy, a finding that demonstrates the potential forensic applications of studying indoor air microbiology. We also identified which bacterial taxa were indicators of female and male rooms, and found that those taxa often identified as members of the vaginal microbiome were more common in female-occupied rooms while taxa associated with human skin or the male urogenital microbiota were more common in male-occupied rooms.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological contamination around organic waste bins at three distances over a 12-month period. Contamination near the customary trash of control households was evaluated at the beginning to ensure that there is no recruitment bias. Air samples using the MAS 100 impactor were carried out in 38 dwellings that do household waste composting and in 10 dwellings of controls. Collection of particles by CIP 10 rotating cup sampler and dust samples collected by electrostatic dust collector cloths were acquired in dwellings that do household waste composting. Samples were analyzed by culture and by real-time quantitative PCR. Information about dwelling characteristics and inhabitant practices was obtained by a standardized questionnaire. The genera most often isolated were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Streptomyces. Near the organic waste bins, bioaerosol samples showed an increase of Acarus siro (P = 0.001). Sedimented dust analyses highlighted an increase of A. siro, Wallemia sebi, Aspergillus versicolor, and Cladosporium sphaerospermum concentrations after a 12-month survey compared to the beginning. Composting favors microorganism development over time, but does not seem to have an effect on the bioaerosol levels and the surface microbiota beyond 0.5 m from the waste bin.},

Our objective was to determine how indoor bacterial and fungal community structure and diversity are associated with the broader home environment and its occupants. Next-generation DNA sequencing was used to describe fungal and bacterial communities in house dust sampled from 198 homes of asthmatic children in southern New England. Housing characteristics included number of people/children, level of urbanization, single/multifamily home, reported mold, reported water leaks, air conditioning (AC) use, and presence of pets. Both fungal and bacterial community structures were non-random and demonstrated species segregation (C-score, P {\textless} 0.00001). Increased microbial richness was associated with the presence of pets, water leaks, longer AC use, suburban (vs. urban) homes, and dust composition measures (P {\textless} 0.05). The most significant differences in community composition were observed for AC use and occupancy (people, children, and pets) characteristics. Occupant density measures were associated with beneficial bacterial taxa, including Lactobacillus johnsonii as measured by qPCR. A more complete knowledge of indoor microbial communities is useful for linking housing characteristics to human health outcomes. Microbial assemblies in house dust result, in part, from the building's physical and occupant characteristics.},

In this study, HVAC filter dust samples in 13 US retail stores were collected and analyzed via pyrosequencing to characterize the indoor bacterial communities and to explore potential relationships between these communities and building and environmental parameters. Although retail stores contained a diverse bacterial community of 788 unique genera, over half of the nearly 118K sequences were attributed to the Proteobacteria phylum. Streptophyta, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter were the most prevalent genera detected. The recovered indoor airborne microbial community was statistically associated with both human oral and skin microbiota, indicating occupants are important contributors, despite a relatively low occupant density per unit volume in retail stores. Bacteria generally associated with outdoor environments were present in the indoor communities with no obvious association with air exchange rate, even when considering relative abundance. No significant association was observed between the indoor bacterial community recovered and store location, store type, or season. However, predictive functional gene profiling showed significant associations between the indoor community and season. The microbiome recovered from multiple samples collected months apart from the same building varied significantly indicating that caution is warranted when trying to characterize the bacterial community with a single sampling event.},

Therefore, understanding the microbiome in water-damaged homes is critical to preventing these illnesses. Few studies have quantified bacterial contamination, especially specific species, in water-damaged homes. We collected air and dust samples in twenty-one low-mold homes and twenty-one high-mold homes. The concentrations of three bacteria/genera, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptomyces sp., and Mycobacterium sp., were measured in air and dust samples using quantitative PCR (QPCR). The concentrations of the bacteria measured in the air samples were not associated with any specific home characteristic based on multiple regression models. However, higher concentrations of S. maltophilia in the dust samples were associated with water damage, that is, with higher floor surface moisture and higher concentrations of moisture-related mold species. The concentrations of Streptomyces and Mycobacterium sp. had similar patterns and may be partially determined by human and animal occupants and outdoor sources of these bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.

The goal of this research was to explore associations among measured dampness, fungal exposure, and childhood asthma development without the bias of culture-based microbial analysis. In the low-income, Latino CHAMACOS birth cohort, house dust was collected at age 12 months, and asthma status was determined at age 7 years. The current analysis included 13 asthma cases and 28 controls. Next-generation DNA sequencing methods quantified fungal taxa and diversity. Lower fungal diversity (number of fungal operational taxonomic units) was significantly associated with increased risk of asthma development: unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.80 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.04-22.1). Control for potential confounders strengthened this relationship. Decreased diversity within the genus Cryptococcus was significantly associated with increased asthma risk (OR 21.0, 95{\%} CI 2.16-204). No fungal taxon (species, genus, class) was significantly positively associated with asthma development, and one was significantly negatively associated. Elevated moisture was associated with increased fungal diversity, and moisture/mold indicators were associated with four fungal taxa.

The concentration of endotoxins was also estimated. About 96{\%} of the sequences were classified as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. At the genus level, about 30{\%} of sequences from the exhaust filter were classified as bacteria of probable human origin, such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species. These were close to absent in intake dust samples ({\textless}1{\%}). This suggests that occupancy shapes the indoor microbiota, creating an environment relatively rich in genera of potential health significance. There were significantly greater counts of culturable bacteria and fungi in exhaust samples, indicating that passage of air through the nursery causes deterioration in the general air quality. Although there was more endotoxin in exhaust dust, the endotoxin levels per colony forming unit were similar in both samples. This study explores, for the first time, the bacterial composition of ventilation filter dust in Norwegian nurseries, and is important as it reveals what types of microorganisms nursery users are exposed to. In addition to possible direct health issues, the nature of our early exposure to microbes may be significant in the development of immunological conditions.},

Fungal sequences were phylogenetically most closely related to Eurotium, Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium, Alternaria, Phaeosphaeria, Capnodiales and Pleosporales taxa. SEM analysis showed that Eurotium halophilicum is dominant on the two infected volumes. Viable airborne fungal loads near the two volumes were higher than recommended maximum values, demonstrating that airborne fungi could represent a source of risk. The airborne microbial community sampled in two different seasons was composed by fungi belonging in the genera Aspergillus, Candida and Eurotium. The detection of E. halophilicum also in the archival air indicated a possible source of contamination. Fluctuations of thermo-hygrometric values were also observed in the archive in the different seasons. The occurrence of white efflorescence on the stored volumes most likely depended on the lack of both a dusting programme and air-conditioning, and insufficient ventilation in the repository, and, on the hygroscopic behaviour of the binding materials used in the manufacture of the volumes.},

However, the overall diversity of the bacterial community residing on the surfaces in these indoor environments is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the overall bacterial ecology of selected fitness centers in a metropolitan area (Memphis, TN, USA) utilizing culture-independent pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Samples were collected from the skin-contact surfaces (e.g., exercise instruments, floor mats, handrails, etc.) within fitness centers. Taxonomical composition revealed the abundance of Firmicutes phyla, followed by Proteobacter and Actinobacteria, with a total of 17 bacterial families and 25 bacterial genera. Most of these bacterial genera are of human and environmental origin (including, air, dust, soil, and water). Additionally, we found the presence of some pathogenic or potential pathogenic bacterial genera including Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, and Micrococcus. Staphylococcus was found to be the most prevalent genus. Presence of viable forms of these pathogens elevates risk of exposure of any susceptible individuals. Several factors (including personal hygiene, surface cleaning and disinfection schedules of the facilities) may be the reasons for the rich bacterial diversity found in this study. The current finding underscores the need to increase public awareness on the importance of personal hygiene and sanitation for public gym users.},

This study identified the association between the time of mold exposure and development of atopic dermatitis and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Method: The association between atopic dermatitis and mold exposure was examined in the Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Diseases birth cohort study (n = 1446). Atopic dermatitis was diagnosed at 1 year of age by pediatric allergists. Exposure to mold was assessed by questionnaire. The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to examine the environmental mycobiome in 20 randomly selected healthy infants and 20 infants with atopic dermatitis at 36 weeks of gestation. Results: Prenatal, but not postnatal, mold exposure was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.01–1.83). Levels of total serum IgE at 1 year of age were higher in infants with atopic dermatitis exposed to mold during pregnancy than in healthy infants not exposed to mold during pregnancy (p = 0.021). The relative abundance of uncultured Ascomycota was higher in infants with atopic dermatitis than in healthy infants. The relative abundance of uncultured Ascomycota correlated with total serum IgE levels at 1 year of age (r = 0.613, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: Indoor mold exposure during the fetal period is associated with development of atopic dermatitis via IgE-mediated allergic inflammation. Avoidance of mold exposure during this critical period might prevent the development of atopic dermatitis.},

abstract = {Background: The links between microbial environmental exposures and asthma are well documented, but no study has combined deep sequencing results from pulmonary and indoor microbiomes of patients with asthma with spirometry, clinical, and endotype parameters. Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the links between indoor microbial exposures and pulmonary microbial communities and to document the role of microbial exposures on inflammatory and clinical outcomes of patients with severe asthma (SA). Methods: A total of 55 patients with SA from the national Cohort of Bronchial Obstruction and Asthma cohort were enrolled for analyzing their indoor microbial flora through the use of electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs). Among these patients, 22 were able to produce sputum during “stable” or pulmonary “exacerbation” periods and had complete pairs of EDC and sputum samples, both collected and analyzed. We used amplicon targeted metagenomics to compare microbial communities from EDC and sputum samples of patients according to type 2 (T2)-asthma endotypes. Results: Compared with patients with T2-low SA, patients with T2-high SA exhibited an increase in bacterial $\alpha$-diversity and a decrease in fungal $\alpha$-diversity of their indoor microbial florae, the latter being significantly correlated with fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels. The $\beta$-diversity of the EDC mycobiome clustered significantly according to T2 endotypes. Moreover, the proportion of fungal taxa in common between the sputum and EDC samples was significantly higher when patients exhibited acute exacerbation. Conclusion: These results illustrated, for the first time, a potential association between the indoor mycobiome and clinical features of patients with SA, which should renew interest in deciphering the interactions between indoor environment, fungi, and host in asthma.},

abstract = {Background: Early-life indoor bacterial exposure is associated with the risk of asthma, but the roles of specific bacterial genera are poorly understood. Objective: We sought to determine whether individual bacterial genera in indoor microbiota predict the development of asthma. Methods: Dust samples from living rooms were collected at 2 months of age. The dust microbiota was characterized by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing amplicons of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Children (n = 373) were followed up for ever asthma until the age of 10.5 years. Results: Richness was inversely associated with asthma after adjustments (P = .03). The phylogenetic microbiota composition in asthmatics patients' homes was characteristically different from that in nonasthmatic subjects' homes (P = .02, weighted UniFrac, adjusted association, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, PERMANOVA-S). The first 2 axis scores of principal coordinate analysis of the weighted UniFrac distance matrix were inversely associated with asthma. Of 658 genera detected in the dust samples, the relative abundances of 41 genera correlated (r {\textgreater} |0.4|) with one of these axes. Lactococcus genus was a risk factor for asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36 [95{\%} CI, 1.13-1.63] per interquartile range change). The abundance of 12 bacterial genera (mostly from the Actinomycetales order) was associated with lower asthma risk (P {\textless} .10), although not independently of each other. The sum relative abundance of these 12 intercorrelated genera was significantly protective and explained the majority of the association of richness with less asthma. Conclusion: Our data confirm that phylogenetic differences in the microbiota of infants' homes are associated with subsequent asthma risk and suggest that communities of selected bacteria are more strongly linked to asthma protection than individual bacterial taxa or mere richness.},

abstract = {Background: Environmental exposures in early life appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma, but the potentially modifiable exposures that lead to asthma remain uncertain. Objective: We sought to identify early-life environmental risk factors for childhood asthma in a birth cohort of high-risk inner-city children. Methods: We examined the relationship of prenatal and early-life environmental factors to the occurrence of asthma at 7 years of age among 442 children. Results: Higher house dust concentrations of cockroach, mouse, and cat allergens in the first 3 years of life were associated with lower risk of asthma (for cockroach allergen: odds ratio per interquartile range increase in concentration, 0.55; 95{\%} CI, 0.36-0.86; P {\textless}.01). House dust microbiome analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing identified 202 and 171 bacterial taxa that were significantly (false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05) more or less abundant, respectively, in the homes of children with asthma. A majority of these bacteria were significantly correlated with 1 of more allergen concentrations. Other factors associated significantly positively with asthma included umbilical cord plasma cotinine concentration (odds ratio per geometric SD increase in concentration, 1.76; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-3.09; P =.048) and maternal stress and depression scores. Conclusion: Among high-risk inner-city children, higher indoor levels of pet or pest allergens in infancy were associated with lower risk of asthma. The abundance of a number of bacterial taxa in house dust was associated with increased or decreased asthma risk. Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and higher maternal stress and depression scores in early life were associated with increased asthma risk.},

abstract = {Background Allergic and nonallergic asthma severity in children can be affected by microbial exposures. Objective We sought to examine associations between exposures to household microbes and childhood asthma severity stratified by atopic status. Methods Participants (n = 196) were selected from a cohort of asthmatic children in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Children were grouped according to asthma severity (mild with no or minimal symptoms and medication or moderate to severe persistent) and atopic status (determined by serum IgE levels). Microbial community structure and concentrations in house dust were determined by using next-generation DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between asthma severity and exposure metrics, including richness, taxa identification and quantification, community composition, and concentration of total fungi and bacteria. Results Among all children, increased asthma severity was significantly associated with an increased concentration of summed allergenic fungal species, high total fungal concentrations, and high bacterial richness by using logistic regression in addition to microbial community composition by using the distance comparison t test. Asthma severity in atopic children was associated with fungal community composition (P = .001). By using logistic regression, asthma severity in nonatopic children was associated with total fungal concentration (odds ratio, 2.40; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-5.44). The fungal genus Volutella was associated with increased asthma severity in atopic children (P = .0001, q = 0.04). The yeast genera Kondoa might be protective; Cryptococcus species might also affect asthma severity. Conclusion Asthma severity among this cohort of children was associated with microbial exposure, and associations differed based on atopic status.},

abstract = {Exposure to particular microbiome compositions in the built environment can affect human health and well-being. Identifying the drivers of these indoor microbial assemblages is key to controlling the microbiota of the built environment. In the present study, we used culture and metabarcoding of the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer ribosomal RNA region to assess whether small-scale variation in the built environment influences the diversity, composition and structure of indoor air fungal communities between a heating and an unheated season. Passive dust collectors were used to collect airborne fungi from 259 dwellings representative of three major building periods and five building environments in one city—Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland)—over a heating and an unheated period. A homogenous population (one or two people with an average age of 75 years) inhabited the households. Geographic information systems were used to assess detailed site characteristics (altitude, proximity to forest, fields and parks, proximity to the lake, and density of buildings and roads) for each building. Our analysis indicated that season was the factor that explained most of the variation in colonies forming unit (CFU) concentration and indoor mycobiome composition, followed by the period of building construction. Fungal assemblages were more diverse during the heating season than during the unheated season. Buildings with effective insulation had distinct mycobiome compositions from those built before 1975 — regardless of whether they were constructed with pre-1945 technology and materials or 1945 — 1974 ones. The urban landscape—as a whole—was a significant predictor of cultivable Penicillium load—the closer the building was to the lake, the higher the Penicillium load—but not of fungal community composition. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of eleven fungal taxa detected by metabarcoding decreased significantly with the urbanization gradient. When urban landscape descriptors were analyzed separately, the explanatory power of proximity to vegetation in shaping fungal assemblages become significant, indicating that land cover type had an influence on fungal community structure that was obscured by the effects of building age and sampling season. In conclusion, indoor mycobiomes are strongly modulated by season, and their assemblages are shaped by the effectiveness of building insulation, but are weakly influenced by the urban landscape.},

abstract = {Clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bioaerosols have become a greater threat to public health. However, few reports have shown that ARB and ARGs were found in the atmosphere. High-throughput sequencing applied to environmental sciences has enhanced the exploration of microbial populations in atmospheric samples. Thus, five nosocomial bioaerosols were collected, and the dominant microbial and pathogenic microorganisms were identified by high-throughput sequencing in this study. The results suggested that the dominant microorganisms at the genus level were Massilia, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Methylophilus, Micrococcineae, and Corynebacterineae. The most abundant pathogenic microorganisms were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Arcobacter butzleri, Aeromonas veronii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. The relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors was evaluated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Meanwhile, differences in the pathogenic bacteria between bioaerosols and dust in a typical hospital was investigated. Furthermore, cultivable Staphylococcus isolates with multi-drug resistance phenotype ({\textgreater}3 antibiotics) in the inpatient departments were much higher than those in the transfusion area and out-patient departments, possibly attributed to the dense usage of antibiotics in inpatient departments. The results of this study might be helpful for scientifically air quality control in hospitals.},

abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used to characterize the microbiological composition of both the indoor and outdoor environments of dwellings. Our study aimed to evaluate metabarcoding and bioinformatic analysis resulting from calibrated samples and samples collected by an electrostatic dust collector (EDC) in dwellings with no moisture problems. Thus, the fungal communities of 14 dwellings (eastern France, Franche-Comt{\'{e}} region) were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq technology after amplification of the ITS2 region. Using the standard samples of 11 species of yeasts and molds allowed us to validate the Operational taxonomic units (OTU) assignment. These calibrated samples also showed a low amplification bias, a low rate of sequencing errors and the semi-quantitative nature of the technique. Only one species from the calibrated samples (Lichtheimia corymbifera) was less amplified probably due to the presence of two mismatches in its3 primer. EDC analysis identified 3594 OTU with 75{\%} of reads corresponding to 30 genera. The main genera are those usually found by culture techniques (Penicillium, Aspergillus and Cladosporium), but findings also indicate others less commonly isolated in culture such as Epicoccum, the fourth detected genus in our study. The type of heating systems was correlated with fungal diversity. We found less diversity in the dwellings with wood heating and larger quantities of Epicoccum nigrum verified by qPCR. DNA metabarcoding analysis applied to EDC seems promising. However, we think that it must be used along with qPCR, to obtain a more global view of microbial ecology and relative quantification of species of interest within communities.},

abstract = {Archaea are widespread and abundant in soils, oceans, or human and animal gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. However, very little is known about the presence of Archaea in indoor environments and factors that can regulate their abundances. Using a quantitative PCR approach, and targeting the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes in floor dust samples, we found that Archaea are a common part of the indoor microbiota, 5.01 ± 0.14 (log 16S rRNA gene copies/g dust, mean ± SE) in bedrooms and 5.58 ± 0.13 in common rooms, such as living rooms. Their abundance, however, was lower than bacteria: 9.20 ± 0.32 and 9.17 ± 0.32 in bedrooms and common rooms, respectively. In addition, by measuring a broad array of environmental factors, we obtained preliminary insights into how the abundance of total archaeal 16S rRNA gene copies in indoor environment would be associated with building characteristics and occupants' activities. Based on the results, Archaea are not equally distributed within houses, and the areas with greater input of outdoor microbiome and higher traffic and material heterogeneity tend to have a higher abundance of Archaea. Nevertheless, more research is needed to better understand causes and consequences of this microbial group in indoor environments.},

abstract = {Sequence-based surveys of microorganisms in varied environments have found extremely diverse assemblages. A standard practice in current high-throughput sequence (HTS) approaches in microbial ecology is to sequence the composition of many environmental samples at once by pooling amplicon libraries at a common concentration before processing on one run of a sequencing platform. Biomass of the target taxa, however, is not typically determined prior to HTS, and here, we show that when abundances of the samples differ to a large degree, this standard practice can lead to a perceived bias in community richness and composition. Fungal signal in settled dust of five university teaching laboratory classrooms, one of which was used for a mycology course, was surveyed. The fungal richness and composition in the dust of the nonmycology classrooms were remarkably similar to each other, while the mycology classroom was dominated by abundantly sporulating specimen fungi, particularly puffballs, and appeared to have a lower overall richness based on rarefaction curves and richness estimators. The fungal biomass was three to five times higher in the mycology classroom than the other classrooms, indicating that fungi added to the mycology classroom swamped the background fungi present in indoor air. Thus, the high abundance of a few taxa can skew the perception of richness and composition when samples are sequenced to an even depth. Next, we used in silico manipulations of the observed data to confirm that a unique signature can be identified with HTS approaches when the source is abundant, whether or not the taxon identity is distinct. Lastly, aerobiology of indoor fungi is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Background: Childhood cognitive development depends on neuroimmune interactions. Immunomodulation by early-life microbial exposure may influence neuropsychological function. In this study, we investigate the association between residential indoor microbiota and cognition and behavior among preschoolers. Results: Indoor-settled dust bacterial and fungal characteristics were assessed using 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing (microbial diversity) and qPCR measurements (microbial loads). Child behavior was assessed using four scales: peer relationship, emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Cognitive function was assessed using four tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) software. The first two tasks were designed to assess attention and psychomotor speed (Motor Screening (MOT) and Big/Little Circle (BLC)) and the last two to evaluate the child's visual recognition/working memory (Spatial Span (SSP) and Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS)). Among the 172 included children (age 4–6 years), we observed a 51{\%} (95{\%}CI;75{\%};9{\%}) lower odds of children scoring not normal for hyperactivity and a decrease of 3.20{\%} (95{\%}CI, −6.01{\%}; −0.30{\%}) in BLC response time, for every IQR increase in fungal Shannon diversity. Contrarily, microbial loads were directly associated with SDQ scales and response time. For example, a 2-fold increase in Gram-positive bacterial load was associated with 70{\%} (95{\%}CI 18{\%}; 156{\%}) higher odds of scoring not normal for hyperactivity and an increase of 5.17{\%} (95{\%}CI 0.87{\%}; 9.65{\%}) in DMS response time. Conclusions: Our findings show that early-life exposure to diverse indoor fungal communities is associated with better behavioral and cognitive outcomes, whereas higher indoor microbial load was associated with worse outcomes.

We conducted an environmental assessment as part of an epidemiologic study of 50 elementary schools in a large city in the northeastern USA. We vacuumed dust from the edges of the floor in 500 classrooms accounting for 499 processed dust aliquots for 16S Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize bacterial assemblages. DNA sequences were organized into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and identified using a database derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Bacterial diversity and ecological analyses were performed at the genus level. We identified 29 phyla, 57 classes, 148 orders, 320 families, 1193 genera, and 2045 species in 3073 OTUs. The number of genera per school ranged from 470 to 705. The phylum Proteobacteria was richest of all while Firmicutes was most abundant. The most abundant order included Lactobacillales , Spirulinales , and Clostridiales . Halospirulina was the most abundant genus, which has never been reported from any school studies before. Gram-negative bacteria were more abundant and richer (relative abundance = 0.53; 1632 OTUs) than gram-positive bacteria (0.47; 1441). Outdoor environment-associated genera were identified in greater abundance in the classrooms, in contrast to homes where human-associated bacteria are typically more abundant. Effects of school location, degree of water damage, building condition, number of students, air temperature and humidity, floor material, and classroom's floor level on the bacterial richness or community composition were statistically significant but subtle, indicating relative stability of classroom microbiome from environmental stress. Our study indicates that classroom floor dust had a characteristic bacterial community that is different from typical house dust represented by more gram-positive and human-associated bacteria. Health implications of exposure to the microbiomes in classroom floor dust may be different from those in homes for school staff and students.},

abstract = {Background: Studies in developed countries have reported that the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, and this phenomenon is associated with urbanization and changing indoor microbiome exposure. Developing countries such as China have experienced rapid urbanization in past years, but no study has investigated microbiome exposure and urban-rural health effects in these countries. Methods: Nine high schools from urban and rural areas were randomly selected in Shanxi Province, China, and classroom vacuum dust was collected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A self-administered questionnaire was collected from 1332 students for personal information and health data. Three-level logistic regression was performed between microbial richness/abundance/functional pathways and the occurrence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms. Results: Consistent with developed countries, the prevalence of wheeze and rhinitis was higher in urban areas than in rural areas (p {\textless} 0.05). Metagenomic profiling revealed 8302 bacterial, 395 archaeal, 744 fungal, 524 protist and 1103 viral species in classroom dust. Actinobacteria (mean relative abundance 49.7{\%}), Gammaproteobacteria (18.4{\%}) and Alphaproteobacteria (10.0{\%}) were the most abundant bacterial classes. The overall microbiome composition was significantly different between urban and rural schools (p = 0.001, Adonis). Species from Betaproteobactera, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli were enriched in urban schools, and species from Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were enriched in rural schools. Potential pathogens were present in higher abundance in urban schools than in rural schools (p {\textless} 0.05). Pseudoalteromonas, Neospora caninum and Microbacterium foliorum were positively associated with the occurrence of wheeze, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis, and Brachybacterium was protectively (negatively) associated with rhinitis (p {\textless} 0.01). The abundance of human endocrine and metabolic disease pathways was positively associated with rhinitis (p = 0.008), and butyrate and propionate metabolic genes and pathways were significantly enriched in rural schools (p {\textless} 0.005), in line with previous findings that these short-chain fatty acids protect against inflammatory diseases in the human gut. Conclusions: We conducted the first indoor microbiome survey in urban/rural environments with shotgun metagenomics, and the results revealed high-resolution microbial taxonomic and functional profiling and potential health effects.

abstract = {Background: From early life, children are exposed to a multitude of environmental exposures, which may be of crucial importance for healthy development. Here, the environmental microbiota may be of particular interest as it represents the interface between environmental factors and the child. As infants in modern societies spend a considerable amount of time indoors, we hypothesize that the indoor bed dust microbiota might be an important factor for the child and for the early colonization of the airway microbiome. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the influence of environmental exposures on 577 dust samples from the beds of infants together with 542 airway samples from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 cohort. Results: Both bacterial and fungal community was profiled from the bed dust. Bacterial and fungal diversity in the bed dust was positively correlated with each other. Bacterial bed dust microbiota was influenced by multiple environmental factors, such as type of home (house or apartment), living environment (rural or urban), sex of siblings, and presence of pets (cat and/or dog), whereas fungal bed dust microbiota was majorly influenced by the type of home (house or apartment) and sampling season. We further observed minor correlation between bed dust and airway microbiota compositions among infants. We also analyzed the transfer of microbiota from bed dust to the airway, but we did not find evidence of transfer of individual taxa. Conclusions: Current study explores the influence of environmental factors on bed dust microbiota (both bacterial and fungal) and its correlation with airway microbiota (bacterial) in early life using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings demonstrate that bed dust microbiota is influenced by multiple environmental exposures and could represent an interface between environment and child.

abstract = {The particulate and biological components of indoor air have a substantial impact on human health, especially immune respiratory conditions such as asthma. To better explore the relationship between allergens, the microbial community, and the indoor living environment, we sampled the bedrooms of 65 homes in the Chicago area using 23the patient-friendly Inspirotec electrokinetic air sampling device, which collects airborne particles for characterization of both allergens and microbial DNA. The sampling device captured sufficient microbial material to enable 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to be generated for every sample in the study. Neither the presence of HEPA filters nor the height at which the air sampling device was placed had any influence on the microbial community profile. A core microbiota of 31 OTUs was present in more than three quarters of the samples, comprising around 45{\%} of the relative sequence counts in each bedroom. The most abundant single organisms were Staphylococcus, with other core taxa both human and outdoor-associated. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly increased in bedrooms that reported having open windows, those with flowering plants in the vicinity, and those in homes occupied by dogs. Porphyromonas, Moraxella, Sutterella, and Clostridium, along with family Neisseraceae, were significantly enriched in homes with dogs; interestingly, cats did not show a significant impact on microbial diversity or relative abundance. While dog allergen load was significantly correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, the taxa that significantly correlated with allergen burden did not exclusively overlap with those enriched in homes with dogs. Alternaria allergen load was positively correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, while Aspergillus allergen load was negatively correlated. The Alternaria allergen load was also significantly correlated with open windows. Microbial communities were significantly differentiated between rural, suburban, and urban homes and houses that were physically closer to each other maintained significantly more similar microbiota. We have demonstrated that it is possible to determine significant associations between allergen burden and the microbiota in air from the same sample and that these associations relate to the characteristics of the home and neighborhoods.},

abstract = {Background: Floor dust is commonly used for microbial determinations in epidemiological studies to estimate early-life indoor microbial exposures. Resuspension of floor dust and its impact on infant microbial exposure is, however, little explored. The aim of our study was to investigate how floor dust resuspension induced by an infant's crawling motion and an adult walking affects infant inhalation exposure to microbes. Results: We conducted controlled chamber experiments with a simplified mechanical crawling infant robot and an adult volunteer walking over carpeted flooring. We applied bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR to monitor the infant breathing zone microbial content and compared that to the adult breathing zone and the carpet dust as the source. During crawling, fungal and bacterial levels were, on average, 8-to 21-fold higher in the infant breathing zone compared to measurements from the adult breathing zone. During walking experiments, the increase in microbial levels in the infant breathing zone was far less pronounced. The correlation in rank orders of microbial levels in the carpet dust and the corresponding infant breathing zone sample varied between different microbial groups but was mostly moderate. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa was characteristically distinct in carpet dust and infant and adult breathing zones during the infant crawling experiments. Bacterial diversity in carpet dust and the infant breathing zone did not correlate significantly. Conclusions: The microbiota in the infant breathing zone differ in absolute quantitative and compositional terms from that of the adult breathing zone and of floor dust. Crawling induces resuspension of floor dust from carpeted flooring, creating a concentrated and localized cloud of microbial content around the infant. Thus, the microbial exposure of infants following dust resuspension is difficult to predict based on common house dust or bulk air measurements. Improved approaches for the assessment of infant microbial exposure, such as sampling at the infant breathing zone level, are needed.},

abstract = {Background: In Norway, 91{\%} of children aged 1-5 attend kindergarten where they are exposed to indoor microbiomes which can have relevance for development and health. In order to gain a better understanding of the composition of the indoor microbiome and how it is affected by occupancy over time, floor dust samples from a newly opened kindergarten were investigated. Samples were collected during an 11-month period. Samples were analyzed for bacterial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Samples were also screened for four clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes. In addition, Petrifilm analyses were used to evaluate surface hygiene. Results: Significant changes in the microbial community composition were observed over time (PERMANOVA, P {\textless} 0.05). Particularly, changes in the abundance and the proportions of human associated bacteria were found. A decrease in the prevalence of Propionibacterium from over 16{\%} abundance to less than 1{\%} and an increase in Streptococcus from 10 to 16{\%} were the most significant findings. Four classes of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes were tested for; three were detected in the dust, indicating the presence of resistant bacteria and a potential for resistance spread. Petrifilm analysis showed that some surfaces in the kindergarten were of consistent poor hygienic quality, and new hygienic routines are required. Conclusions: This study, which is the first of its kind performed at a newly opened kindergarten, reveals changes in the microbiome over time as well as the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and hygiene issues which are of relevance for occupant health.},

abstract = {Background: Microbial communities associated with indoor dust abound in the built environment. The transmission of sunlight through windows is a key building design consideration, but the effects of light exposure on dust communities remain unclear. We report results of an experiment and computational models designed to assess the effects of light exposure and wavelengths on the structure of the dust microbiome. Specifically, we placed household dust in replicate model "rooms" with windows that transmitted visible, ultraviolet, or no light and measured taxonomic compositions, absolute abundances, and viabilities of the resulting bacterial communities. Results: Light exposure per se led to lower abundances of viable bacteria and communities that were compositionally distinct from dark rooms, suggesting preferential inactivation of some microbes over others under daylighting conditions. Differences between communities experiencing visible and ultraviolet light wavelengths were relatively minor, manifesting primarily in abundances of dead human-derived taxa. Daylighting was associated with the loss of a few numerically dominant groups of related microorganisms and apparent increases in the abundances of some rare groups, suggesting that a small number of microorganisms may have exhibited modest population growth under lighting conditions. Although biological processes like population growth on dust could have generated these patterns, we also present an alternate statistical explanation using sampling models from ecology; simulations indicate that artefactual, apparent increases in the abundances of very rare taxa may be a null expectation following the selective inactivation of dominant microorganisms in a community. Conclusions: Our experimental and simulation-based results indicate that dust contains living bacterial taxa that can be inactivated following changes in local abiotic conditions and suggest that the bactericidal potential of ordinary window-filtered sunlight may be similar to ultraviolet wavelengths across dosages that are relevant to real buildings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The limited understanding of microbial characteristics in moisture-damaged buildings impedes efforts to clarify which adverse health effects in the occupants are associated with the damage and to develop effective building intervention strategies. The objectives of this current study were (i) to characterize fungal and bacterial microbiota in house dust of severely moisture-damaged residences, (ii) to identify microbial taxa associated with moisture damage renovations, and (iii) to test whether the associations between the identified taxa and moisture damage are replicable in another cohort of homes. We applied bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing complemented with quantitative PCR and chemical-analytical approaches to samples of house dust, and also performed traditional cultivation of bacteria and fungi from building material samples. RESULTS: Active microbial growth on building materials had significant though small influence on the house dust bacterial and fungal communities. Moisture damage interventions-including actual renovation of damaged homes and cases where families moved to another home-had only a subtle effect on bacterial community structure, seen as shifts in abundance weighted bacterial profiles after intervention. While bacterial and fungal species richness were reduced in homes that were renovated, they were not reduced for families that moved houses. Using different discriminant analysis tools, we were able identify taxa that were significantly reduced in relative abundance during renovation of moisture damage. For bacteria, the majority of candidates belonged to different families within the Actinomycetales order. Results for fungi were overall less consistent. A replication study in approximately 400 homes highlighted some of the identified taxa, confirming associations with observations of moisture damage and mold. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is one of the first studies to analyze changes in microbiota due to moisture damage interventions using high-throughput sequencing. Our results suggest that effects of moisture damage and moisture damage interventions may appear as changes in the abundance of individual, less common, and especially bacterial taxa, rather than in overall community structure.},

abstract = {Background: Microbes can grow in indoor environments if moisture is available, and we need an improved understanding of how this growth contributes to emissions of microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs). The goal of this study was to measure how moisture levels, building material type, collection site, and microbial species composition impact microbial growth and emissions of mVOCs. We subjected two common building materials, drywall, and carpet, to treatments with varying moisture availability and measured microbial communities and mVOC emissions. Results: Fungal growth occurred in samples at {\textgreater}75{\%} equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) for carpet with dust and {\textgreater}85{\%} ERH for inoculated painted drywall. In addition to incubated relative humidity level, dust sample collection site (adonis p=0.001) and material type (drywall, carpet, adonis p=0.001) drove fungal and bacterial species composition. Increased relative humidity was associated with decreased microbial species diversity in samples of carpet with dust (adonis p= 0.005). Abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that accounted for {\textgreater}1{\%} emissions were likely released from building materials and the dust itself. However, certain mVOCs were associated with microbial growth from carpet with dust such as C10H16H+ (monoterpenes) and C2H6SH+ (dimethyl sulfide and ethanethiol). CO2 production from samples of carpet with dust at 95{\%} ERH averaged 5.92 mg hr-1 kg-1, while the average for carpet without dust at 95{\%} ERH was 2.55 mg hr-1 kg-1. Conclusion: Microbial growth and mVOC emissions occur at lower relative humidity in carpet and floor dust compared to drywall, which has important implications for human exposure. Even under elevated relative humidity conditions, the VOC emissions profile is dominated by non-microbial VOCs, although potential mVOCs may dominate odor production.

abstract = {Background: The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) contains a unique cohort of patients with underdeveloped immune systems and nascent microbiome communities. Patients often spend several months in the same room, and it has been previously shown that the gut microbiomes of these infants often resemble the microbes found in the NICU. Little is known, however, about the identity, persistence, and absolute abundance of NICU room-associated bacteria over long stretches of time. Here, we couple droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), 16S rRNA gene surveys, and recently published metagenomics data from infant gut samples to infer the extent to which the NICU microbiome is shaped by its room occupants. Results: Over 2832 swabs, wipes, and air samples were collected from 16 private-style NICU rooms housing very low birth weight ({\textless} 1500 g), premature ({\textless} 31 weeks' gestation) infants. For each infant, room samples were collected daily, Monday through Friday, for 1 month. The first samples from the first infant and the last samples from the last infant were collected 383 days apart. Twenty-two NICU locations spanning room surfaces, hands, electronics, sink basins, and air were collected. Results point to an incredibly simple room community where 5-10 taxa, mostly skin-associated, account for over 50{\%} of the amplicon reads. Biomass estimates reveal four to five orders of magnitude difference between the least to the most dense microbial communities, air, and sink basins, respectively. Biomass trends from bioaerosol samples and petri dish dust collectors suggest occupancy to be a main driver of suspended biological particles within the NICU. Using a machine learning algorithm to classify the origin of room samples, we show that each room has a unique microbial fingerprint. Several important taxa driving this model were dominant gut colonizers of infants housed within each room. Conclusions: Despite regular cleaning of hospital surfaces, bacterial biomass was detectable at varying densities. A room-specific microbiome signature was detected, suggesting microbes seeding NICU surfaces are sourced from reservoirs within the room and that these reservoirs contain actively dividing cells. Collectively, the data suggests that hospitalized infants, in combination with their caregivers, shape the microbiome of NICU rooms.},

abstract = {Background: Establishing reliable methods for assessing the microbiome within the built environment is critical for understanding the impact of biological exposures on human health. High-throughput DNA sequencing of dust samples provides valuable insights into the microbiome present in human-occupied spaces. However, the effect that different sampling methods have on the microbial community recovered from dust samples is not well understood across sample types. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters hold promise as long-term, spatially integrated, high volume samplers to characterize the airborne microbiome in homes and other climate-controlled spaces. In this study, the effect that dust recovery method (i.e., cut and elution, swabbing, or vacuuming) has on the microbial community structure, membership, and repeatability inferred by Illumina sequencing was evaluated. Results: The results indicate that vacuum samples captured higher quantities of total, bacterial, and fungal DNA than swab or cut samples. Repeated swab and vacuum samples collected fromthe same filter were less variable than cut samples with respect to both quantitative DNA recovery and bacterial community structure. Vacuum samples captured substantially greater bacterial diversity than the other methods, whereas fungal diversity was similar across all three methods. Vacuum and swab samples of HVAC filter dust were repeatable and generally superior to cut samples. Nevertheless, the contribution of environmental and human sources to the bacterial and fungal communities recovered via each sampling method was generally consistent across the methods investigated. Conclusions: Dust recovery methodologies have been shown to affect the recovery, repeatability, structure, and membership of microbial communities recovered from dust samples in the built environment. The results of this study are directly applicable to indoor microbiota studies utilizing the filter forensics approach. More broadly, this study provides a better understanding of the microbial community variability attributable to sampling methodology and helps inform interpretation of data collected from other types of dust samples collected from indoor environments.},

abstract = {Background: The International Space Station (ISS) represents a unique biotope for the human crew but also for introduced microorganisms. Microbes experience selective pressures such as microgravity, desiccation, poor nutrient-availability due to cleaning, and an increased radiation level. We hypothesized that the microbial community inside the ISS is modified by adapting to these stresses. For this reason, we analyzed 8–12 years old dust samples from Russian ISS modules with major focus on the long-time surviving portion of the microbial community. We consequently assessed the cultivable microbiota of these samples in order to analyze their extremotolerant potential against desiccation, heat-shock, and clinically relevant antibiotics. In addition, we studied the bacterial and archaeal communities from the stored Russian dust samples via molecular methods (next-generation sequencing, NGS) and compared our new data with previously derived information from the US American ISS dust microbiome. Results: We cultivated and identified in total 85 bacterial, non-pathogenic isolates (17 different species) and 1 fungal isolate from the 8–12 year old dust samples collected in the Russian segment of the ISS. Most of these isolates exhibited robust resistance against heat-shock and clinically relevant antibiotics. Microbial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene targeting Next Generation Sequencing showed signatures of human-associated microorganisms (Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Coprococcus etc.), but also specifically adapted extremotolerant microorganisms. Besides bacteria, the detection of archaeal signatures in higher abundance was striking. Conclusions: Our findings reveal (i) the occurrence of living, hardy microorganisms in archived Russian ISS dust samples, (ii) a profound resistance capacity of ISS microorganisms against environmental stresses, and (iii) the presence of archaeal signatures on board. In addition, we found indications that the microbial community in the Russian segment dust samples was different to recently reported US American ISS microbiota.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. RESULTS: Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Settled airborne dust is used as a surrogate for airborne exposure in studies that explore indoor microbes. In order to determine whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the sampler type, we compared different passive, settled dust sampling approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota. RESULTS: Settled dust sampling approaches-utilizing plastic petri dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs)-were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a sampling environment regardless of the sampler type. The sampling environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community composition within a study, while sampler type was found to have much less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with EDCs and TefTex. The highest correlations between duplicate samples were observed for EDC and petri dish approaches, indicating greater experimental repeatability for these sampler types. For the EDC samples, it became apparent that, due to the fibrous nature of the material, a rigorous extraction protocol is crucial to obtain optimal yields and stable, repeatable results. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between sampler types were strong both in compositional and quantitative terms, and thus, the particular choice of passive settled dust sampler is not likely to strongly alter the overall conclusion of a study that aims to characterize dust across different environments. Microbial cell abundances determined from settled dust varied with the use of different sampling approaches, and thus, consistency in the method is necessary to allow for absolute comparisons within and among studies.

abstract = {The indoor microbial community is a mixture of microorganisms resulting from outdoor ecosystems that seed the built environment. However, the biogeography of the indoor microbial community is still inadequately studied. Dust from more than 3000 dwellings across France was analyzed by qPCR using 17 targets: 10 molds, 3 bacteria groups, and 4 mites. Thus, the first spatial description of the main indoor microbial allergens on the French territory, in relation with biogeographical factors influencing the distribution of microorganisms, was realized in this study. Ten microorganisms out of 17 exhibited increasing abundance profiles across the country: Five microorganisms (Dermatophago{\"{i}}des pteronyssinus, Dermatophago{\"{i}}des spp., Streptomyces spp., Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Epicoccum nigrum) from northeast to southwest, two (Cryptococcus spp., Alternaria alternata) from northwest to southeast, Mycobacteria from east to west, Aspergillus fumigatus from south to north, and Penicillium chrysogenum from south to northeast. These geographical patterns were partly linked to climate and land cover. Multivariate analysis showed that composition of communities seemed to depend on landscapes, with species related to closed and rather cold and humid landscapes (forests, located in the northeast) and others to more open, hot, and dry landscapes (herbaceous and coastal regions, located in the west). This study highlights the importance of geographical location and outdoor factors that shape communities. In order to study the effect of microorganisms on human health (allergic diseases in particular), it is important to identify biogeographic factors that structure microbial communities on large spatial scales and to quantify the exposure with quantitative tools, such as the multi-qPCR approach.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria are ever-present, mainly flourishing in aquatic environments and surviving virtually in other habitats. The microbiota of indoor dust on the pre-filter of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which reflect indoor microbial contamination and affect human health, has attracted attention. Contemporary studies on cyanobacteria deposited on the pre-filter of HVAC remain scant. By the culture-independent approach of qPCR and high throughput sequencing technologies, our results documented that the cyanobacterial concentrations were highest in autumn, occurred recurrently, and were about 2.60 and 10.57-fold higher than those in winter and summer. We proposed that aquatic and terrestrial cyanobacteria contributed to the pre-filter of HVAC by airborne transportation produced by wave breaks, bubble bursts, and soil surface by wind force, owing to the evidence that cyanobacteria were commonly detected in airborne particulate matters. The cyanobacteria community structure was characterized in Shanghai, where Chroococcidiopsaceae, norank{\_}cyanobacteriales, Nostocaceae, Paraspirulinaceae, and others dominated the dust on the pre-filter of HVAC. Some detected genera, including Nodularia sp., Pseudanabaena sp., and Leptolyngbya sp., potentially produced cyanobacterial toxins, which need further studying to determine their potential threat to human health. The present work shed new insight into cyanobacteria distribution in the specific environment besides aquatic habitats.},

abstract = {In the built environment, fungi can cause important deterioration of building materials and have adverse health effects on occupants. Increased knowledge about indoor mycobiomes from different regions of the world, and their main environmental determinants, will enable improved indoor air quality management and identification of health risks. This is the first citizen science study of indoor mycobiomes at a large geographical scale in Europe, including 271 houses from Norway and 807 dust samples from three house compartments: outside of the building, living room and bathroom. The fungal community composition determined by DNA metabarcoding was clearly different between indoor and outdoor samples, but there were no significant differences between the two indoor compartments. The 32 selected variables, related to the outdoor environment, building features and occupant characteristics, accounted for 15{\%} of the overall variation in community composition, with the house compartment as the key factor (7.6{\%}). Next, climate was the main driver of the dust mycobiomes (4.2{\%}), while building and occupant variables had significant but minor influences (1.4{\%} and 1.1{\%}, respectively). The house‐dust mycobiomes were dominated by ascomycetes (⁓70{\%}) with Capnodiales and Eurotiales as the most abundant orders. Compared to the outdoor samples, the indoor mycobiomes showed higher species richness, which is probably due to the mixture of fungi from outdoor and indoor sources. The main indoor indicator fungi belonged to two ecological groups with allergenic potential: xerophilic moulds and skin‐associated yeasts. Our results suggest that citizen science is a successful approach for unravelling the built microbiome at large geographical scales.},

abstract = {Asthma prevalence has increased in epidemic proportions with urbanization, but growing up on traditional farms offers protection even today1. The asthma-protective effect of farms appears to be associated with rich home dust microbiota2,3, which could be used to model a health-promoting indoor microbiome. Here we show by modeling differences in house dust microbiota composition between farm and non-farm homes of Finnish birth cohorts4 that in children who grow up in non-farm homes, asthma risk decreases as the similarity of their home bacterial microbiota composition to that of farm homes increases. The protective microbiota had a low abundance of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and total bacterial load and was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings in a study among rural German children2 and showed that children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased asthma risk. The indoor dust microbiota composition appears to be a definable, reproducible predictor of asthma risk and a potential modifiable target for asthma prevention.},

abstract = {Background: Children who grow up in environments that afford them a wide range of microbial exposures, such as traditional farms, are protected from childhood asthma and atopy. In previous studies, markers of microbial exposure have been inversely related to these conditions. Methods: In two cross-sectional studies, we compared children living on farms with those in a reference group with respect to the prevalence of asthma and atopy and to the diversity of microbial exposure. In one study - PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy - Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle) - samples of mattress dust were screened for bacterial DNA with the use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses to detect environmental bacteria that cannot be measured by means of culture techniques. In the other study - GABRIELA (Multidisciplinary Study to Identify the Genetic and Environmental Causes of Asthma in the European Community [GABRIEL] Advanced Study) - samples of settled dust from children's rooms were evaluated for bacterial and fungal taxa with the use of culture techniques. Results: In both studies, children who lived on farms had lower prevalences of asthma and atopy and were exposed to a greater variety of environmental microorganisms than the children in the reference group. In turn, diversity of microbial exposure was inversely related to the risk of asthma (odds ratio for PARSIFAL, 0.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.89; odds ratio for GABRIELA, 0.86; 95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 0.99). In addition, the presence of certain more circumscribed exposures was also inversely related to the risk of asthma; this included exposure to species in the fungal taxon eurotium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.18 to 0.76) and to a variety of bacterial species, including Listeria monocytogenes, bacillus species, corynebacterium species, and others (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95{\%} CI, 0.38 to 0.86). Conclusions: Children living on farms were exposed to a wider range of microbes than were children in the reference group, and this exposure explains a substantial fraction of the inverse relation between asthma and growing up on a farm.

abstract = {Hospital-acquired infections remain a serious threat to human life and are becoming a top public health issue. As the latest advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the unbiased identification of bacterial communities, we aimed to implement emerging omics technologies to characterize a hospital's microbiome at the center of Cairo, Egypt. To this end, we screened surfaces and inanimate objects in the hospital, focusing on bed sheets and door knobs, with additional screening for resistant microbes and resistance genes. While bacterial load and community composition were not dramatically different between door knobs of hospital units with different hygiene levels, the bacterial communities on door knob samples were richer and more diverse than those detected on bed sheets. Bacteria detected on door knobs were a mix of those associated with dust/particulate matter/debris (e.g., Bacillus, Geobacillus, Aeribacillus) and skin-associated bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium). The latter were among the core genera shared by all analyzed samples. Conversely, bacteria that were more abundant in bed sheets were not associated with a particular source (e.g., Pseudomonas and Nitrobacter). Resistance screening indicated an expansion of a mobile beta-lactamase-encoding gene (blaTEM), reflecting its current global spread. This study is a first step toward more comprehensive screening of hospital surfaces and correlating their microbiome with hospital outbreaks or chronic infections. We conclude that, as hospitals are unique built environments, these findings can inform future infection control strategies in hospitals and health care-related built environments, and attest to the importance of the emerging hospital microbiome research field.},

The aim of this study was to describe the composition of the cultivated microbiota in dust samples collected in sport facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. A dust sample is defined as the airborne dust sedimented on 0.02 m2 within 28 d. The results show that the microbial viable counts in samples of airborne dust (n = 9) collected from seven Finnish sport facilities during the pandemic contained a high proportion of pathogenic filamentous fungi and a low proportion of bacteria. The microbial viable counts were between 14 CFU and 189 CFU per dust sample. In seven samples from sport facilities, 20–85{\%} of the microbial viable counts were fungi. Out of 123 fungal colonies, 47 colonies belonged to the potentially pathogenic sections of Aspergillus (Sections Fumigati, Nigri, and Flavi). Representatives of each section were identified as Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger and A. tubingensis. Six colonies belonged to the genus Paecilomyces. In six samples of dust, a high proportion (50–100{\%}) of the total fungal viable counts consisted of these potentially pathogenic fungi. A total of 70 isolates were considered less likely to be pathogenic, and were identified as Aspergillus section Nidulantes, Chaetomium cochliodes and Penicillium sp. In the rural (n = 2) and urban (n = 7) control dust samples, the microbial viable counts were {\textgreater}2000 CFU and between 44 CFU and 215 CFU, respectively, and consisted mainly of bacteria. The low proportion of bacteria and the high proportion of stress tolerant, potentially pathogenic fungi in the dust samples from sport facilities may reflect the influence of disinfection on microbial communities.},

abstract = {Introduction: Tobacco smoke contains numerous toxic chemicals that accumulate in indoor environments creating thirdhand smoke (THS). We investigated if THS-polluted homes differed in children's human and built-environment microbiomes as compared to THS-free homes. Methods: Participants were n = 19 THS-exposed children and n = 10 unexposed children (≤5 years) and their caregivers. Environmental and biological samples were analyzed for THS pollutants and exposure. Swab samples were collected from the built-environment (floor, table, armrest, bed frame) and child (finger, nose, mouth, and ear canal), and 16S ribosomal RNA genes were analyzed for bacterial taxa using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Results: Phylogenetic $\alpha$-diversity was significantly higher for the built-environment microbiomes in THS-polluted homes compared to THS-free homes (p {\textless} 0.014). Log2-fold comparison found differences between THS-polluted and THS-free homes for specific genera in samples from the built-environment (e.g., Acinetobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Corynebacterium, Gemella, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Veillonella) and in samples from children (esp. Corynebacterium, Gemella, Lautropia, Neisseria, Rothia, Staphylococcus, and Veillonella). Conclusion: When exposed to THS, indoor and children microbiomes are altered in an environment-specific manner. Changes are similar to those reported in previous studies for smokers and secondhand smoke-exposed persons. THS-induced changes in child and built-environmental microbiomes may play a role in clinical outcomes in children. Impact: Despite smoking bans, children can be exposed to tobacco smoke residue (i.e., thirdhand smoke) that lingers on surfaces and in settled house dust.Thirdhand smoke exposure is associated with changes in the microbiomes of the home environment and of the children living in these homes.Thirdhand smoke is associated with increased phylogenetic diversity of the home environment and changes in the abundances of several genera of the child microbiome known to be affected by active smoking and secondhand smoke (e.g., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus).Thirdhand smoke exposure by itself may induce alterations in the microbiome that play a role in childhood pathologies.},

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrate an exchange of bacteria between hospital room surfaces and patients, and a reduction in survival of microorganisms in dust inside buildings from sunlight exposure. While the transmission of microorganisms between humans and their local environment is a continuous exchange which generally does not raise cause for alarm, in a hospital setting with immunocompromised patients, these building-source microbial reservoirs may pose a risk. Window glass is often neglected during hospital disinfection protocols, and the microbial communities found there have not previously been examined. This pilot study examined whether living bacterial communities, and specifically the pathogens Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), were present on window components of exterior-facing windows inside patient rooms, and whether relative light exposure (direct or indirect) was associated with changes in bacterial communities on those hospital surfaces. Environmental samples were collected from 30 patient rooms in a single ward at Oregon Health {\&} Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon, USA. Sampling locations within each room included the window glass surface, both sides of the window curtain, two surfaces of the window frame, and the air return grille. Viable bacterial abundances were quantified using qPCR, and community composition was assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3/V4 region. Viable bacteria occupied all sampled locations, but was not associated with a specific hospital surface or relative sunlight exposure. Bacterial communities were similar between window glass and the rest of the room, but had significantly lower Shannon Diversity, theorized to be related to low nutrient density and resistance to bacterial attachment of glass compared to other surface materials. Rooms with windows that were facing west demonstrated a higher abundance of viable bacteria than those facing other directions, potentially because at the time of sampling (morning) west-facing rooms had not yet been exposed to sunlight that day. Viable C. difficile was not detected and viable MRSA was detected at very low abundance. Bacterial abundance was negatively correlated with distance from the central staff area containing the break room and nursing station. In the present study, it can be assumed that there is more human traffic in the center of the ward, and is likely responsible for the observed gradient of total abundance in rooms along the ward, as healthcare staff both deposit more bacteria during activities and affect microbial transit indoors. Overall, hospital window components possess similar microbial communities to other previously identified room locations known to act as reservoirs for microbial agents of hospital-associated infections.},

DEHP adsorbs from material and leaches into soil, water, or dust and presents an exposure risk to building occupants by inhalation, ingestion, or absorption. A number of bacterial isolates are demonstrated to degrade DEHP in culture, but bacteria may be susceptible to it as well, thus this study examined the relation of DEHP to bacterial communities in dust. Polyvinyl chloride flooring was seeded with homogenized house dust and incubated for up to 14 days, and bacterial communities in dust were identified at days 1, 7, and 14 using the V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. DEHP concentration in dust increased over time, as expected, and bacterial richness and Shannon diversity were negatively correlated with DEHP concentration. Some sequence variants of Bacillus , Corynebacterium jeddahense , Streptococcus , and Peptoniphilus were relatively more abundant at low concentrations of DEHP, while some Sphingomonas , Chryseobacterium , and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family were relatively more abundant at higher concentrations. The built environment is known to host lower microbial diversity and biomass than natural environments, and DEHP or other chemicals indoors may contribute to this paucity.},

abstract = {People spend most of their time inside buildings and the indoor microbiome is a major part of our everyday environment. It affects humans' wellbeing and therefore its composition is important for use in inferring human health impacts. It is still not well understood how environmental conditions affect indoor microbial communities. Existing studies have mostly focussed on the local (e.g., building units) or continental scale and rarely on the regional scale, e.g. a specific metropolitan area. Therefore, we wanted to identify key environmental determinants for the house dust microbiome from an existing collection of spatially (area of Munich, Germany) and temporally (301 days) distributed samples and to determine changes in the community as a function of time. To that end, dust samples that had been collected once from the living room floors of 286 individual households, were profiled for fungal and bacterial community variation and diversity using microbial fingerprinting techniques. The profiles were tested for their association with occupant behaviour, building characteristics, outdoor pollution, vegetation, and urbanization. Our results showed that more environmental and particularly outdoor factors (vegetation, urbanization, airborne particulate matter) affected the community composition of indoor fungi than of bacteria. The passage of time affected fungi and, surprisingly, also strongly affected bacteria. We inferred that fungal communities in indoor dust changed semi-annually, whereas bacterial communities paralleled outdoor plant phenological periods. These differences in temporal dynamics cannot be fully explained and should be further investigated in future studies on indoor microbiomes.},

abstract = {Background: Architectural design has the potential to influence the microbiology of the built environment, with implications for human health and well-being, but the impact of design on the microbial biogeography of buildings remains poorly understood. In this study we combined microbiological data with information on the function, form, and organization of spaces from a classroom and office building to understand how design choices influence the biogeography of the built environment microbiome. Results: Sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene from dust samples revealed that indoor bacterial communities were extremely diverse, containing more than 32,750 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, 97{\%} sequence similarity cutoff), but most communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Deinococci. Architectural design characteristics related to space type, building arrangement, human use and movement, and ventilation source had a large influence on the structure of bacterial communities. Restrooms contained bacterial communities that were highly distinct from all other rooms, and spaces with high human occupant diversity and a high degree of connectedness to other spaces via ventilation or human movement contained a distinct set of bacterial taxa when compared to spaces with low occupant diversity and low connectedness. Within offices, the source of ventilation air had the greatest effect on bacterial community structure. Conclusions: Our study indicates that humans have a guiding impact on the microbial biodiversity in buildings, both indirectly through the effects of architectural design on microbial community structure, and more directly through the effects of human occupancy and use patterns on the microbes found in different spaces and space types. The impact of design decisions in structuring the indoor microbiome offers the possibility to use ecological knowledge to shape our buildings in a way that will select for an indoor microbiome that promotes our health and well-being. {\textcopyright} 2014 Kembel et al.},

abstract = {Genetic analysis of indoor air has uncovered a rich microbial presence, but rarely have both the bacterial and fungal components been examined in the same samples. Here we present a study that examined the bacterial component of passively settled microbes from both indoor and outdoor air over a discrete time period and for which the fungal component has already been reported. Dust was allowed to passively settle in five common locations around a home - living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and balcony - at different dwellings within a university-housing complex for a one-month period at two time points, once in summer and again in winter. We amplified the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in these samples and analyzed them with high-throughput sequencing. Like fungal OTU-richness, bacterial OTU-richness was higher outdoors then indoors and was invariant across different indoor room types. While fungal composition was structured largely by season and residential unit, bacterial composition varied by residential unit and room type. Bacteria from putative outdoor sources, such as Sphingomonas and Deinococcus, comprised a large percentage of the balcony samples, while human-associated taxa comprised a large percentage of the indoor samples. Abundant outdoor bacterial taxa were also observed indoors, but the reverse was not true; this is unlike fungi, in which the taxa abundant indoors were also well-represented outdoors. Moreover, there was a partial association of bacterial composition and geographic distance, such that samples separated by even a few hundred meters tended have greater compositional differences than samples closer together in space, a pattern also observed for fungi. These data show that while the outdoor source for indoor bacteria and fungi varies in both space and time, humans provide a strong and homogenizing effect on indoor bacterial bioaerosols, a pattern not observed in fungi. {\textcopyright} 2014 Adams et al.},

abstract = {Most of our time is spent indoors where we are exposed to a wide array of different microorganisms living on surfaces and in the air of our homes. Despite their ubiquity and abundance, we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity found within homes and how the composition and diversity of microbial communities change across different locations within the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes. Together this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the microbial communities found in the home and the factors that shape the structure of these communities both within and between homes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Dunn et al.},

abstract = {Fungi are ubiquitous components of indoor human environments, where most contact between humans and microbes occurs. The majority of these organisms apparently play a neutral role, but some are detrimental to human lifestyles and health. Recent studies that used culture-independent sampling methods demonstrated a high diversity of indoor fungi distinct from that of outdoor environments. Others have shown temporal fluctuations of fungal assemblages in human environments and modest correlations with human activity, but global-scale patterns have not been examined, despite the manifest significance of biogeography in other microbial systems. Here we present a global survey of fungi from indoor environments ( n = 72), using both taxonomic and phylogeny-informative molecular markers to determine whether global or local indoor factors determine indoor fungal composition. Contrary to common ecological patterns, we show that fungal diversity is significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics, with distance from the equator being the best predictor of phylogenetic community similarity. Fungal composition is significantly auto-correlated at the national and hemispheric spatial scales. Remarkably, building function has no significant effect on indoor fungal composition, despite stark contrasts between architecture and materials of some buildings in close proximity. Distribution of individual taxa is significantly range- and latitude-limited compared with a null model of randomized distribution. Our results suggest that factors driving fungal composition are primarily global rather than mediated by building design or function.},

abstract = {We spend the majority of our lives indoors; yet, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of how the microbial communities found in homes vary across broad geographical regions and what factors are most important in shaping the types of microorganisms found inside homes. Here, we investigated the fungal and bacterial communities found in settled dust collected from inside and outside approximately 1200 homes located across the continental US, homes that represent a broad range of home designs and span many climatic zones. Indoor and outdoor dust samples harboured distinct microbial communities, but these differences were larger for bacteria than for fungi with most indoor fungi originating outside the home. Indoor fungal communities and the distribution of potential allergens varied predictably across climate and geographical regions; where you live determines what fungi live with you inside your home. By contrast, bacterial communities in indoor dust were more strongly influenced by the number and types of occupants living in the homes. In particular, the female : male ratio and whether a house had pets had a significant influence on the types of bacteria found inside our homes highlighting that who you live with determines what bacteria are found inside your home.},

In this study, air-borne MFs were collected from fallout or air-conditioner (AC) filter dust in three types of indoor space including living room, dormitory and office. Both plastic and natural MFs were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Ultramicroscopic observation showed dense biofilms adhering on surfaces of MFs. Fallout MFs contained more bacteria but fewer fungi than MFs from AC filter dust. MFs-loaded bacteria were of highest abundance in living rooms, following dormitories and offices. Bacterial community and its diversity were further analyzed by 16S rRNA High-throughput sequencing. Up to 4540 of bacterium OTUs were shared in these MFs samples, unique OTUs in fallout and AC filter samples accounting for 26.3 {\%} and 25.7 {\%} of the total. Compared to MFs fallout, AC filter MFs contained more species of pathogenic bacteria, such as Betaproteobacteriales and Ralstonia, with obviously different $\beta$-diversity between two groups. Phenotypic analysis showed that fallout and AC filter MFs bacteria presented high index values of film formation, oxidative stress tolerance and potential pathogenicity. Overall, these results suggest that abundant bacteria including pathogen can be loaded on MFs, and would pose health risks through delivery of indoor MFs.},

The occurrence of SBS is associated with humidity, ventilation, moulds and microbial compounds exposure. However, no study has reported the association between indoor microbiome and SBS. In this study, 308 students were surveyed for SBS symptoms from 21 classrooms of 7 junior high schools from Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and vacuum dust from floor, desks and chairs was collected. High throughput amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene and ITS region) and quantitative PCR were conducted to characterize the absolute concentration of bacteria and fungi taxa. In total, 326 bacterial and 255 fungal genera were detected in dust with large compositional variation among classrooms. Also, half of these samples showed low compositional similarity to microbiome data deposited in the public database. The number of observed OTUs in Gammaproteobacteria was positively associated with SBS (p = 0.004). Eight microbial genera were associated with SBS (p {\textless} 0.01). Bacterial genera, Rhodomicrobium, Scytonema and Microcoleus, were protectively (negatively) associated with ocular and throat symptoms and tiredness, and Izhakiella and an unclassified genus from Euzebyaceae were positively associated with the throat and ocular symptoms. Three fungal genera, Polychaeton, Gympopus and an unclassified genus from Microbotryaceae, were mainly positively associated with tiredness. The associations differed with our previous study in microbial compounds (endotoxin and ergosterol) and SBS in the same population, in which nasal and dermal symptoms were affected. A higher indoor relative humidity and visible dampness or mould in classrooms were associated with a higher concentration of potential risk bacteria and a lower concentration of potential protective bacteria (p {\textless} 0.01). This is the first study to characterize the SBS-associated microorganisms in the indoor environment, revealing complex interactions between microbiome, SBS symptoms and environmental characteristics.},

Indoor microbial composition is associated with SBS symptoms, but the impact of microbial functional genes and potential metabolic products has not been characterized. We conducted a shotgun microbial metagenomic sequencing for vacuum dust collected in urban and rural schools in Shanxi province, China. SBS symptoms in students were surveyed, and microbial taxa and functional pathways related to the symptoms were identified using a multi-level linear regression model. SBS symptoms were common in students, and the prevalence of ocular and throat symptoms, headache, and tiredness was higher in urban than in rural areas (p {\textless} 0.05). A significant higher microbial $\alpha$-diversity was found in rural areas than in urban areas (Chao1, p = 0.001; ACE, p = 0.002). Also, significant variation in microbial taxonomic and functional composition ($\beta$-diversity) was observed between urban and rural areas (p {\textless} 0.005). Five potential risk Actinobacteria species were associated with SBS symptoms (p {\textless} 0.01); students in the classrooms with a higher abundance of an unclassified Geodermatophilaceae, Geodermatophilus, Fridmanniella luteola, Microlunatus phosphovorus and Mycetocola reported more nasal and throat symptoms and tiredness. Students with a higher abundance of an unclassified flavobacteriaceae reported fewer throat symptoms and tiredness. The abundance of microbial metabolic pathways related to the synthesis of B vitamins (biotin and folate), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and peptidoglycan and were protectively (negatively) associated with SBS symptoms (FDR {\textless} 0.05). The result is consistent with human microbiota studies, which reported that these microbial products are extensively involved in immunological processes and anti-inflammatory effects. This is the first study to report the functional potential of the indoor microbiome and the occurrence of SBS, providing new insights into the potential etiologic mechanisms in chronic inflammatory diseases.},

Bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations pose severe challenges in elderly and low-income housing. They void large amounts of liquid feces into the home environment, which might alter the indoor microbial community composition. In this study, using bed bug-infested and uninfested homes, we showed a strong impact of bed bug infestations on the indoor microbial diversity. Floor dust samples were collected from uninfested and bed bug-infested homes and their microbiomes were analyzed before and after heat interventions that eliminated bed bugs. The microbial communities of bed bug-infested homes were radically different from those of uninfested homes, and the bed bug endosymbiont Wolbachia was the major driver of this difference. After bed bugs were eliminated, the microbial community gradually shifted toward the community composition of uninfested homes, strongly implicating bed bugs in shaping the dust-associated environmental microbiome. Further studies are needed to understand the viability of these microbial communities and the potential risks that bed bug-associated microbes and their metabolites pose to human health.},

The current study is a subset of a multicenter study that aims to investigate the indoor environment of green homes and the respiratory health of asthmatic children. In the current study, the mycobiome in air, bed dust and floor dust was compared between green (study site) and non-green (control site), low-income homes in Cincinnati, Ohio. The samples were collected at baseline (within four months following renovation), and 12 months after the baseline at the study site. Parallel sample collection was conducted in non-green control homes. Air samples were collected by PM2.5 samplers over 5-days. Bed and floor dust samples were vacuumed after the air sampling was completed. The DNA sample extracts were analyzed using ITS amplicon sequencing. Analysis indicated that there was no clear trend in the fungal communities between green and non-green homes. Instead, fungal community differences were greatest between sample types - air, bed, and floor. Microbial communities also changed substantially between sampling intervals in both green and non-green homes for all sample types, potentially indicating that there was very little stability in the mycobiomes. Research gaps remain regarding how indoor mycobiome fluctuates over time. Longer follow-up periods might elucidate the effect of green renovation on microbial load in buildings.},

abstract = {The study aimed at investigating Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in moldy and non-moldy homes, as defined by the home's Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) value. The ERMI values were determined from floor dust samples in 2010 and 2011 and homes were classified into low ({\textless}. 5) and high ({\textgreater}. 5) ERMI groups based on the average ERMI values as well as 2011 ERMI values. Dust and air samples were collected from the homes in 2011 and all samples were analyzed for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using QPCR assays, endotoxin by the LAL assay, and N-acetyl-muramic acid using HPLC. In addition, air samples were analyzed for culturable bacteria. When average ERMI values were considered, the concentration and load of Gram-positive bacteria determined with QPCR in house dust, but not air, were significantly greater in high ERMI homes than in low ERMI homes. Furthermore, the concentration of endotoxin, but not muramic acid, in the dust was significantly greater in high ERMI than in low ERMI homes. In contrast, when ERMI values of 2011 were considered, Gram-negative bacteria determined with QPCR in air, endotoxin in air, and muramic acid in dust were significantly greater in high ERMI homes. The results suggest that both short-term and long-term mold contamination in homes could be linked with the bacterial concentrations in house dust, however, only the current mold status was associated with bacterial concentrations in air. Although correlations were found between endotoxin and Gram-negative bacteria as well as between muramic acid and Gram-positive bacteria in the entire data set, diverging associations were observed between the different measures of bacteria and the home moldiness. It is likely that concentrations of cells obtained by QPCR and concentrations of cell wall components are not equivalent and represent too broad categories to understand the bacterial composition and sources of the home microbiota. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

A high proportion of fungal allergens (34.37 {\%}–56.50 {\%}), which can cause skin diseases and asthma, were observed. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed the essential ecological role of microbial interactions in the development of a healthy immune system. Overall, we revealed the differences in microbial communities at different sampling sites within a single indoor environment, highlighting the distribution of potential pathogens and ecological functions of microbes, and providing a new perspective and information for assessing indoor health from a microbiological viewpoint.},

abstract = {Dust samples collected by researchers and study participants from 43 U.S. urban homes were analyzed and compared to evaluate the feasibility of using participant-collected samples to assess indoor environmental exposures. The microbial and chemical composition of participant-collected (and shipped) samples were compared to researcher-collected samples from the same household, using dust recovered from each home's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filter. The bacterial and fungal communities present in all dust samples were determined via MiSeq 16S and ITS sequencing, and the concentrations of 27 semi-volatile organic compounds (7 orthophosphates, 6 phthalates, and 14 brominated flame retardants) were determined via GC–MS. Self-report data on the home environment was collected via an online survey of study participants. While the researcher-collected samples (RCS) yielded greater mass than the participant-collected samples (PCS), the alpha and beta diversities of the bacterial and fungal communities recovered in the RCS and PCS were not significantly different, indicating that PCS is a viable option for indoor microbiome studies of residential homes. The microbial communities recovered in both cases reflected the dominance of human-associated bacterial taxa and outdoor-associated fungal taxa with similar pathogen-associated taxa present in each sample type. In both PCS and RCS, the amount of carpet in the home and the frequency of bleach use had a significant effect on the composition of fungal communities. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of potential human health concern, were commonly detected in the homes. Organophosphates and phthalates were recovered at a similar frequency in both PCS and RCS. Measured SVOC concentration levels were consistent with previous indoor studies although differences were observed between PCS and RCS for several SVOCs. This study demonstrates the potential and challenges associated with participant-collected dust samples for indoor environment studies.},

abstract = {Collecting and obtaining sufficient amount of airborne particles for multiple microbial component assessments can be challenging. A passive dust sampling device, the electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) has been established for assessing airborne exposures including endotoxin and glucans. Recently, with advances in next-generation sequencing techniques, EDCs were used to collect microbial cells for DNA sequencing analysis to promote the study of airborne bacterial and fungal communities. However, low DNA yields have been problematic when employing passive sampling with EDC. To address this challenge, we attempted to increase the efficiency of extraction. We compared DNA extraction efficiency of bacterial components from EDCs captured on filters through filtration using five extraction techniques. By measuring the abundance, diversity and structure of bacterial communities using qPCR and amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes, we found that two techniques outperformed the rest. Furthermore, we developed protocols to simultaneously extract both DNA and endotoxin from a single EDC cloth. Our technique promotes a high quality to price ratio and may be employed in large epidemiological studies addressing airborne bacterial exposure where a large number of samples is needed.},

Moreover, most do not target the different groups of microorganisms involved in respiratory diseases (fungi, bacteria, dust mites).In our study, ten specific qPCR targets (6 fungal species, 1 family and 2 genera of bacteria, 1 house dust mite) were used to analyze the microorganism composition of electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) from 3193 dwellings of the Elfe French cohort study.Multivariate analyses allowed us to show that the microbial composition of dwellings, assessed with simultaneous analysis of 10 microorganisms, can be characterized by four entities: three bacteria, house dust mite Dermatophago{\"{i}}des pteronyssinus, fungi Alternaria alternata, and five other molds.Some dwellings' intrinsic characteristics (occupational ratio, type of dwelling and presence of pets) clearly influence microorganism distribution, and six different profiles of dwellings, characterized by their composition in microorganisms, have been described across France.The use of these clusters seems promising in the evaluation of allergic risk. Allergic respiratory diseases will develop in the near future in some children of the Elfe cohort and will indicate to what extent our approach can be predictive of respiratory disease.},

The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of dog ownership on house dust microbiota composition. The bacterial and fungal microbiota was characterized with Illumina MiSeq sequencing from floor dust samples collected from homes in a Finnish rural-suburban (LUKAS2, N = 182) birth cohort, and the results were replicated in a German urban (LISA, N = 284) birth cohort. Human associated bacteria variable was created by summing up the relative abundances of five bacterial taxa. Bacterial richness, Shannon index and the relative abundances of seven bacterial genera, mostly within the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes , were significantly higher in the dog than in the non-dog homes, whereas the relative abundance of human associated bacteria was lower. The results were largely replicated in LISA. Fungal microbiota richness and abundance of Leucosporidiella genus were higher in dog homes in LUKAS2 and the latter association replicated in LISA. Our study confirms that dog ownership is reproducibly associated with increased bacterial richness and diversity in house dust and identifies specific dog ownership-associated genera. Dogs appeared to have more limited influence on the fungal than bacterial indoor microbiota.},

Bedroom floor dust was collected at age 3 months and 4 bacterial and fungal diversity measures [number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices] were calculated from Illumina MiSeq sequencing data. Hyperactivity/inattention was based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at ages 10 and 15 (cut-off ≥7). Adjusted associations between 4 diversity measures in tertiles and hyperactivity/inattention were investigated with weighted and survey logistic regression models. We included 226 individuals with information on microbial diversity and hyperactivity/inattention. Early life bacterial diversity was inversely associated with hyperactivity/inattention at age 10 [bacterial OTUs (medium vs low: aOR = 0.4, 95{\%}CI = (0.2–0.8)) and Chao1 (medium vs low: 0.3 (0.1–0.5); high vs low: 0.3 (0.2–0.6)], whereas fungal diversity was directly associated [Chao1 (high vs low: 2.1 (1.1–4.0)), Shannon (medium vs low: 2.8 (1.3–5.8)), and Simpson (medium vs low: 4.7 (2.4–9.3))]. At age 15, only Shannon index was significantly associated with hyperactivity/inattention [bacteria (medium vs low: 2.3 (1.2–4.2); fungi (high vs low: 0.5 (0.3–0.9))]. In conclusion, early life exposure to microbial diversity may play a role in the psychobehavioural development. We observe heterogeneity in the direction of the associations encouraging further longitudinal studies to deepen our understanding of the characteristics of the microbial community underlying the observed associations.},

We found that the viable bacteria proportion in the filter was significantly higher than that in the floor dust ( p {\textless} 0.001). The Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis showed that the bacterial communities in the filters and dust were significantly different ( p = 0.001). The Chao1, Shannon–Wiener and phylogenetic diversity values in the filter were significantly higher than those in the dust ( p {\textless} 0.001). The predominant bacterial classes in the filter were Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria , whereas those in the dust were Bacteroidia , Clostridia and Bacilli . Human occupancy contributed more to the bacterial community in the filter than that in the dust. Klebsiella and Alloprevotella in the dust and filters positively correlated with the occupancy density. Soil bacteria contributed to a significantly higher proportion of the bacteria in the HEPA filter ( p {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, human oral, indoor air and outdoor haze contributed to a higher proportion of the bacteria in the dust samples ( p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.01 and p {\textless} 0.05, respectively). As HEPA filters serve as an ecological niche for indoor bacteria, they should be carefully investigated during the assessment of indoor environmental health.},

With its many advantages such as portability, user friendliness, simplicity, speed of sequencing and long read length, the technology is now an actual contender to established sequencing platforms. MinION's main disadvantage is a relatively low read accuracy compared to several other platforms, although this is constantly improving. The present study, which appears to be the first of its kind, provides the results of a preliminary analysis of the microbial communities in indoor environments based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, using both the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinIOn and the Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencers. At the level of family and above, there was no significant difference between the microbial compositions as revealed by the two platforms.

abstract = {The indoor microbiome is a complex system that is thought to depend on dispersal from the outdoor biome and the occupants' microbiome combined with selective pressures imposed by the occupants' behaviors and the building itself. We set out to determine the pattern of fungal diversity and composition in indoor air on a local scale and to identify processes behind that pattern. We surveyed airborne fungal assemblages within 1-month time periods at two seasons, with high replication, indoors and outdoors, within and across standardized residences at a university housing facility. Fungal assemblages indoors were diverse and strongly determined by dispersal from outdoors, and no fungal taxa were found as indicators of indoor air. There was a seasonal effect on the fungi found in both indoor and outdoor air, and quantitatively more fungal biomass was detected outdoors than indoors. A strong signal of isolation by distance existed in both outdoor and indoor airborne fungal assemblages, despite the small geographic scale in which this study was undertaken ({\textless}500 m). Moreover, room and occupant behavior had no detectable effect on the fungi found in indoor air. These results show that at the local level, outdoor air fungi dominate the patterning of indoor air. More broadly, they provide additional support for the growing evidence that dispersal limitation, even on small geographic scales, is a key process in structuring the often-observed distance–decay biogeographic pattern in microbial communities.},

abstract = {Background: The prevalence of allergy and other common chronic diseases is higher in developed than developing countries, and higher in urban than rural regions. Urbanization through its modification of environmental microbiomes may play a predominant role in the development of these conditions. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the microbiome in house dust among areas with different urbanization levels. Methods: House dust from Xinxiang rural area (XR, n = 74), Xinxiang urban area (XU, n = 33), and Zhengzhou urban area (ZU, n = 32) in central China, and from Australia (AU, n = 58 [with pets AUP, n = 15, without pets AUNP, n = 43]) were collected during a summer season in China and Australia. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA was employed to profile house dust bacterial communities. Results: Settled dust collected in China was dominant with 2 bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while floor dust collected in Australia had a higher proportion of phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. XR dust samples presented higher bacterial richness and diversity compared with XU or ZU samples. Urbanization level (r2 = 0.741 P {\textless} 0.001) had a significant correlation with the distribution of house dust bacterial community. At the genus level, there was a positive correlation (r coefficient {\textgreater} 0.5) between urbanization level and bacterial genera Streptococcus, Bartonella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, Corynebacterium{\_}1, and Enhydrobacter and a negative correlation (r coefficient {\textless} −0.5) with Rhodanobacter. Conclusion: There was a significant difference in house dust microbiota among different urbanization areas. The areas with a lower urbanization level presented higher dust-borne bacterial richness and diversity. Modern urbanization has a significant influence on the bacterial microbiome profiles of indoor dust.},

Microorganism populations in the air can be seasonal or relatively constant, but the most frequent increase in their occurrence is recorded in the summer and autumn. Studies show that humidity, the presence of carbon monoxide and ozone concentrations are the main factors affecting the diversity of bacteria and the percentage of pathogenic bacteria present in outdoor air. Microorganisms in the air inside residential buildings are primarily concentrated on dust particles. Approximately 60{\%} of dust microbiota are spores of mould fungi. The key emitters of microorganisms into the atmosphere are municipal wastewater treatment plants. The bacteria and pathogens released are potentially resistant to antibiotics, rendering the bioaerosols of wastewater treatment plants a possible hazard to human health.

Certain species are associated with certain sources, but the full potential of source characterization and source apportionment has not yet been realized. Ideally, future studies will quantify detailed emission rates of microorganisms from each source and will identify the relative contribution of each source to the indoor air microbiome.

The search involved various databases such as; Science Direct, PubMed, SAGE, Springer Link, EBCOHOST, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane library, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library. It was limited to full text research articles that reported the use of non-viable method in assessing bioaerosol, written in English Language, full text publications and published from year 2015-2022. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria and was included in this review. The use of next-generation sequencing, which is more commonly referred to as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) or molecular methods in microbial studies is based on the detection of genetic material of organisms present in a given sample. Applying these methods to different environments permitted the identification of the microorganisms present, and a better comprehension of the environmental impacts and ecological roles of microbial communities. Based on the reviewed articles, there is evidence that dust samples harbour a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and fungi. Molecular methods such as next generation sequencing are reliable tools for identifying and tracking the bacterial and fungal diversity in dust samples using 18S metagenomics approach.},

abstract = {It has been just over three centuries since Antonie van Leewenhoek first conclusively documented the biological nature of the elements of air and dust in the built environment [1]. During the 20th century, advancements in sampling instrumentation and analysis techniques yielded a large literature on the microbiology of air and dust, mainly using culture and microscopy [2, 3]. In the past few decades, the measurement of health-relevant biochemicals such as allergens, endotoxin, and glucan in the context of population health studies has contributed substantially to our understanding of how the built environment can influence health. In the past few years, investigations of the built environment using culture-independent sequence-based analysis have confirmed many previously held expectations about the sources and fates of indoor microbes, and in the process, these methods have also produced several unexpected insights into the indoor microbiome. Perhaps not surprisingly, the biological composition of air and dust appears to be vastly more complex than formerly thought. Over the next decade, molecular metagenomic methods are likely to revolutionize our understanding of the roles of air and dust in the biology of life on earth, and in the process, provide sophisticated new tools to elucidate health-environment interactions. This review summarizes recent key studies on the microbiology of the built environment to date using modern culture-independent methods, and considers the implications of these findings and future studies elucidating the interactions between the humans and the built environment.},

abstract = {Studies of indoor bioaerosols conducted in Central and Eastern European countries, as a result of the scarcity of funding, mostly do not attain the level presented by similar studies in Northern America and Western Europe. For socio-economic reasons, most of the intense studies on indoor bioaerosols in Central and Eastern European countries were carried out in industrial facilities and have contributed significantly to occupational health science. In contrast, until recently, insufficient of studies have been conducted on bioaerosols of residential and communal premises (dwellings, offices, schools, etc.) and no network for monitoring the microbiological quality of air in such premises exists. In Poland, in the mid-1990s complex bioaerosol investigations were carried out by the Bioaerosol Group at the Institute of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health in Sosnowiec. The concentrations of airborne bacteria and fungi in dwellings without mold problems were between 88-4297 cfu/m(3) and 0-1997 cfu/m(3), while in moldy homes they were 178-4751 cfu/m(3) and 49-16,968 cfu/m(3), respectively. As many as 167 microbial species were isolated from the air of examined dwellings. Most frequently occurred Gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus/ Kocuria spp., Staphylococcus spp.), endospore-forming bacilli (Bacillus spp.), Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonadaceae, Aeromonas spp.), filamentous fungi (Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp.), and yeasts. Notable studies of indoor bioaerosols have also been performed in the other Central and Eastern European countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russian Federation, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary, are reviewed in this article. The lack of reference limit values for bioaerosols seriously hinders interpretation of results obtained in various countries. The following residential limit values (RLV) for dwellings and communal premises are proposed for the concentration of airborne bacteria, fungi and bacterial endotoxin: 5 x 10(3) cfu/m(3), 5 x 10(3) cfu/m(3) and 5 ng/m(3) (50 EU), respectively. The proposed values of occupational exposure limit (OEL) for industrial settings contaminated by organic dust are 100 x (3) cfu/m(3), 50 x (3) cfu/m(3) and 200 ng/m(3) (2000 EU), respectively. It is also proposed that the presence in indoor air of microorganisms from risk groups 3 and 4 of European Community Directive 2000/54/EC (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii), independently of the concentration, should always be inadmissible and result in preventive actions.},

abstract = {Rigorous evidence identification is essential for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (evidence syntheses) because the sample selection of relevant studies determines a review's outcome, validity, and explanatory power. Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query‐based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2 -year probability-based telephone survey (n = 9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CAT1) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63{\%} of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87{\%} of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6{\%} of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid- 1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

abstract = {Causal inference from observational data is the goal of many data analyses in the health and social sciences. However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term "data science" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train data scientists.},

abstract = {In any research study, there is an underlying process that should begin with a clear articulation of the study's goal. The study's goal drives this process; it determines many study features, including the estimand of interest, the analytic approaches that can be used to estimate it, and which coefficients, if any, should be interpreted. Misalignment can occur in this process when analytic approaches and/or interpretations do not match the study's goal; misalignment is potentially more likely to arise when study goals are ambiguously framed. In this study, misalignment in the observational epidemiologic literature was documented and how the framing of study goals contributes to misalignment was explored. The following 2 misalignments were examined: use of an inappropriate variable selection approach for the goal (a “goal–methods” misalignment) and interpretation of coefficients of variables for which causal considerations were not made (e.g., Table 2 Fallacy, a “goal–interpretation” misalignment). A random sample of 100 articles published 2014–2018 in the top 5 general epidemiology journals were reviewed. Most reviewed studies were causal, with either explicitly stated (n = 13; 13{\%}) or associational-framed (n = 71; 69{\%}) aims. Full alignment of goal–methods–interpretations was infrequent (n = 9; 9{\%}), although clearly causal studies (n = 5 of 13; 38{\%}) were more often fully aligned than were seemingly causal ones (n = 3 of 71; 4{\%}). Goal–methods misalignments were common (n = 34 of 103; 33{\%}), but most frequently, methods were insufficiently reported to draw conclusions (n = 47; 46{\%}). Goal–interpretations misalignments occurred in 31{\%} (n = 32) of the studies and occurred less often when the methods were aligned (n = 2; 2{\%}) compared with when the methods were misaligned (n = 13; 13{\%}).},

abstract = {Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: 'Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs' (ESC-DAGs)'. Methods: ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are 'mapped' into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more 'integrated DAGs'. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence. Conclusions: ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.},

abstract = {Understanding modifiable prenatal and early life causal determinants of food allergy is important for the prevention of the disease. Randomized clinical trials studying environmental and dietary determinants of food allergy may not always be feasible. Identifying risk/protective factors for early‐life food allergy often relies on observational studies, which may be affected by confounding bias. The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a causal diagram useful to guide causal inference from observational epidemiological research. To date, research on food allergy has made little use of this promising method. We performed a literature review of existing evidence with a systematic search, synthesized 32 known risk/protective factors, and constructed a comprehensive DAG for early‐life food allergy development. We present an easy‐to‐use online tool for researchers to re‐construct, amend, and modify the DAG along with a user's guide to minimize confounding bias. We estimated that adjustment strategies in 57{\%} of previous observational studies on modifiable factors of childhood food allergy could be improved if the researchers determined their adjustment sets by DAG. Future researchers who are interested in the causal inference of food allergy development in early life can apply the DAG to identify covariates that should and should not be controlled in observational studies.},

abstract = {Background: Time-activity pattern (TAP) is an important parameter for determining personal exposure to environmental pollutants. Changes in TAPs could have significant implications for the alterations in outcomes of exposure assessments. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the Seoul population's long-term change in TAPs, along with variations by sociodemographic group. Methods: In 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019, the Time Use Survey of Statistics Korea collected the TAP information of 4036, 2610, 3337, and 2793 Seoul residents, respectively. In 2022, the TAP information of 4401 Seoul residents was collected for Korean Air Pollutant Exposure (KAPEX) research. The microenvironmental TAP changes in the Seoul population from 2004 to 2022 were assessed based on age, gender, work status, and day type. Results: From 2004 to 2022, Seoul people increasingly spent more time in indoor residences (from 14.8 ± 5.1 h to 15.8 ± 4.5 h) and less time in other indoors (from 7.2 ± 4.5 h to 5.9 ± 4.2 h). Their transit time constantly decreased from 2004 (1.4 ± 1.8 h) to 2022 (1.2 ± 1.3 h), whereas the outdoor time fluctuated throughout the years. From 2004 to 2022, the time of the day spent by Seoul people in residential indoor shifted to later in the morning (2004: 8:30 am; 2022: 9:00 am) and earlier in the evening (2004: 9:30 pm; 2022: 7:00 pm); however, the opposite was true for other indoors (2004: from 8:30 am to 9:30 pm; 2022: from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm) and transits (2004: 7:30–9:30 am and 3:00–8:00 pm; 2022: 7:30–9:00 pm and 5:00–9:00). The time of the day spent in outdoors increased from 2004 to 2019, with a distinct peak observed in 2022 (12:00 pm–2:00 pm). The microenvironmental time trends of adolescents and late-adulthoods differed from those of the other age groups, while those of males differed from females. Also, the microenvironmental time trends of the employed differed from those of the unemployed, and those during weekdays differed from those during weekends. Impact statement: Microenvironmental TAP should be essentially considered to estimate the actual exposure to pollutants. This study demonstrates the Seoul population's long-term changes in TAP throughout the 18 years as the significant parameter in exposure assessment. Notably, the microenvironmental TAPs of Seoul people shifted, with variations across different sociodemographic groups. Previous studies in Korea did not consider the TAP shifts in exposure assessment; this study highlights the importance of aligning TAP data with concurrent environmental pollutant data and emphasizes the need for refined data collection in future exposure assessments.},

abstract = {Given that more than 90{\%} of time in industrialized countries is typically spent indoors, the indoor environment is a key source of environmental exposures contributing to the overall human exposome. Indoor settled dust is of particular interest because of its ubiquitous presence and human exposure across indoor environments; it serves as a sink for many indoor chemicals of concern, particularly plastic additives, personal care product components, pesticides and industrial chemicals, combustion by-products and heavy metals. Nondietary dust ingestion and dermal contact with dust are important routes of human exposure to these chemicals. This review will summarize the properties and composition of typical indoor dust and relate these to the importance of indoor dust as a part of the human exposome.},

abstract = {Summary Background Detailed, comprehensive, and timely reporting on population health by underlying causes of disability and premature death is crucial to understanding and responding to complex patterns of disease and injury burden over time and across age groups, sexes, and locations. The availability of disease burden estimates can promote evidence-based interventions that enable public health researchers, policy makers, and other professionals to implement strategies that can mitigate diseases. It can also facilitate more rigorous monitoring of progress towards national and international health targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. For three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has filled that need. A global network of collaborators contributed to the production of GBD 2021 by providing, reviewing, and analysing all available data. GBD estimates are updated routinely with additional data and refined analytical methods. GBD 2021 presents, for the first time, estimates of health loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The GBD 2021 disease and injury burden analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and injuries using 100 983 data sources. Data were extracted from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, censuses, household surveys, disease-specific registries, health service contact data, and other sources. YLDs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific prevalence of sequelae by their respective disability weights, for each disease and injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific deaths by the standard life expectancy at the age that death occurred. DALYs were calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. HALE estimates were produced using YLDs per capita and age-specific mortality rates by location, age, sex, year, and cause. 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2{\textperiodcentered}5th and 97{\textperiodcentered}5th percentiles values of 500 draws. Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Counts and age-standardised rates were calculated globally, for seven super-regions, 21 regions, 204 countries and territories (including 21 countries with subnational locations), and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. Here we report data for 2010 to 2021 to highlight trends in disease burden over the past decade and through the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Global DALYs increased from 2{\textperiodcentered}63 billion (95{\%} UI 2{\textperiodcentered}44–2{\textperiodcentered}85) in 2010 to 2{\textperiodcentered}88 billion (2{\textperiodcentered}64–3{\textperiodcentered}15) in 2021 for all causes combined. Much of this increase in the number of DALYs was due to population growth and ageing, as indicated by a decrease in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates of 14{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (95{\%} UI 10{\textperiodcentered}7–17{\textperiodcentered}3) between 2010 and 2019. Notably, however, this decrease in rates reversed during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates since 2019 of 4{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}8–6{\textperiodcentered}3) in 2020 and 7{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (4{\textperiodcentered}7–10{\textperiodcentered}0) in 2021. In 2021, COVID-19 was the leading cause of DALYs globally (212{\textperiodcentered}0 million [198{\textperiodcentered}0–234{\textperiodcentered}5] DALYs), followed by ischaemic heart disease (188{\textperiodcentered}3 million [176{\textperiodcentered}7–198{\textperiodcentered}3]), neonatal disorders (186{\textperiodcentered}3 million [162{\textperiodcentered}3–214{\textperiodcentered}9]), and stroke (160{\textperiodcentered}4 million [148{\textperiodcentered}0–171{\textperiodcentered}7]). However, notable health gains were seen among other leading communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Globally between 2010 and 2021, the age-standardised DALY rates for HIV/AIDS decreased by 47{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (43{\textperiodcentered}3–51{\textperiodcentered}7) and for diarrhoeal diseases decreased by 47{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (39{\textperiodcentered}9–52{\textperiodcentered}9). Non-communicable diseases contributed 1{\textperiodcentered}73 billion (95{\%} UI 1{\textperiodcentered}54–1{\textperiodcentered}94) DALYs in 2021, with a decrease in age-standardised DALY rates since 2010 of 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} UI 3{\textperiodcentered}5–9{\textperiodcentered}5). Between 2010 and 2021, among the 25 leading Level 3 causes, age-standardised DALY rates increased most substantially for anxiety disorders (16{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [14{\textperiodcentered}0–19{\textperiodcentered}8]), depressive disorders (16{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [11{\textperiodcentered}9–21{\textperiodcentered}3]), and diabetes (14{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [10{\textperiodcentered}0–17{\textperiodcentered}4]). Age-standardised DALY rates due to injuries decreased globally by 24{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (20{\textperiodcentered}7–27{\textperiodcentered}2) between 2010 and 2021, although improvements were not uniform across locations, ages, and sexes. Globally, HALE at birth improved slightly, from 61{\textperiodcentered}3 years (58{\textperiodcentered}6–63{\textperiodcentered}6) in 2010 to 62{\textperiodcentered}2 years (59{\textperiodcentered}4–64{\textperiodcentered}7) in 2021. However, despite this overall increase, HALE decreased by 2{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}6–2{\textperiodcentered}9) between 2019 and 2021. Interpretation Putting the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of causes of health loss is crucial to understanding its impact and ensuring that health funding and policy address needs at both local and global levels through cost-effective and evidence-based interventions. A global epidemiological transition remains underway. Our findings suggest that prioritising non-communicable disease prevention and treatment policies, as well as strengthening health systems, continues to be crucially important. The progress on reducing the burden of CMNN diseases must not stall; although global trends are improving, the burden of CMNN diseases remains unacceptably high. Evidence-based interventions will help save the lives of young children and mothers and improve the overall health and economic conditions of societies across the world. Governments and multilateral organisations should prioritise pandemic preparedness planning alongside efforts to reduce the burden of diseases and injuries that will strain resources in the coming decades.

abstract = {A fundamental assumption usually made in causal inference is that of no interference between individuals (or units); that is, the potential outcomes of one individual are assumed to be unaffected by the treatment assignment of other individuals. However, in many settings, this assumption obviously does not hold. For example, in the dependent happenings of infectious diseases, whether one person becomes infected depends on who else in the population is vaccinated. In this article, we consider a population of groups of individuals where interference is possible between individuals within the same group. We propose estimands for direct, indirect, total, and overall causal effects of treatment strategies in this setting. Relations among the estimands are established; for example, the total causal effect is shown to equal the sum of direct and indirect causal effects. Using an experimental design with a two-stage randomization procedure (first at the group level, then at the individual level within groups), unbiased estimators of the proposed estimands are presented. Variances of the estimators are also developed. The methodology is illustrated in two different settings where interference is likely: assessing causal effects of housing vouchers and of vaccines. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Statistical Association.},

abstract = {Background: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require conditioning when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research. Methods: Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning ‘directed acyclic graphs' (or similar) or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article's largest DAG. Results: A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n ¼ 48, 21{\%}) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n ¼ 115, 48{\%}) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n ¼ 144, 62{\%}) made at least one DAG available. DAGs varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range (IQR): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs (IQR: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46{\%} (IQR: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37{\%} (n ¼ 53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17{\%} (n ¼ 25) included ‘super-nodes' (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34{\%} (n ¼ 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom). Conclusion: There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.},

abstract = {Objectives: Specifying causal models to assess relationships among metal mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes requires evidence-based models of the causal structures; however, such models have not been previously published. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a directed acyclic graph (DAG) diagraming metal mixture exposure and cardiometabolic outcomes. Methods: We conducted a literature search to develop the DAG of metal mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes. To evaluate consistency of the DAG, we tested the suggested conditional independence statements using linear and logistic regression analyses with data from the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study (SLVDS; n=1795). We calculated the proportion of statements supported by the data and compared this to the proportion of conditional independence statements supported by 1,000 DAGs with the same structure but randomly permuted nodes. Next, we used our DAG to identify minimally sufficient adjustment sets needed to estimate the association between metal mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, fasting glucose, and systolic blood pressure). We applied them to the SLVDS using Bayesian kernel machine regression, linear mixed effects, and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: From the 42 articles included in the review, we developed an evidence-based DAG with 74 testable conditional independence statements (43 {\%} supported by SLVDS data). We observed evidence for an association between As and Mn and fasting glucose. Conclusions: We developed, tested, and applied an evidence-based approach to analyze associations between metal mixtures and cardiometabolic health.},

@article{Antonsen2024,
abstract = {For over a decade, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has tracked and configuration-managed approximately 30 risks that affect astronaut health and performance before, during and after spaceflight. The Human System Risk Board (HSRB) at NASA Johnson Space Center is responsible for setting the official risk posture for each of the human system risks and determining—based on evaluation of the available evidence—when that risk posture changes. The ultimate purpose of tracking and researching these risks is to find ways to reduce spaceflight-induced risk to astronauts. The adverse effects of spaceflight begin at launch and continue throughout the duration of the mission, and in some cases, across the lifetime of the astronaut. Historically, research has been conducted in individual risk “silos” to characterize risk, however, astronauts are exposed to all risks simultaneously. In January of 2020, the HSRB at NASA began assessing the potential value of causal diagramming as a tool to facilitate understanding of the complex causes and effects that contribute to spaceflight-induced human system risk. Causal diagrams in the form of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used to provide HSRB stakeholders with a shared mental model of the causal flow of risk. While primarily improving communication among those stakeholders, DAGs also allow a composite risk network to be created that can be tracked and configuration managed. This paper outlines the HSRB's pilot process for this effort, the lessons learned, and future goals for data-driven risk management approaches.},

abstract = {The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph representing causal pathways for informing the conduct of an observational study. The use of DAGs allows transparent communication of a causal model between researchers and can prevent over-adjustment biases when conducting causal inference, permitting greater confidence and transparency in reported causal estimates. In the era of ‘big data' and increasing number of observational studies, the role of the DAG is becoming more important. Recent best-practice guidance for constructing a DAG with reference to the literature has been published in the ‘Evidence synthesis for constructing DAGs' (ESC-DAG) protocol. We aimed to assess adherence to these principles for DAGs constructed within perioperative literature. Following registration on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting framework for systematic reviews, we searched the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases for perioperative observational research incorporating a DAG. Nineteen studies were included in the final synthesis. No studies demonstrated any evidence of following the mapping stage of the protocol. Fifteen (79{\%}) fulfilled over half of the translation and integration one stages of the protocol. Adherence with one stage did not guarantee fulfilment of the other. Two studies (11{\%}) undertook the integration two stage. Unmeasured variables were handled inconsistently between studies. Only three (16{\%}) studies included unmeasured variables within their DAG and acknowledged their implication within the main text. Overall, DAGs that were constructed for use in perioperative observational literature did not consistently adhere to best practice, potentially limiting the benefits of subsequent causal inference. Further work should focus on exploring reasons for this deviation and increasing methodological transparency around DAG construction.},

abstract = {Measurement and manipulation of the microbiome is generally considered to have great potential for understanding the causes of complex diseases in humans, developing new therapies, and finding preventive measures. Many studies have found significant associations between the microbiome and various diseases; however, Koch's classical postulates remind us about the importance of causative reasoning when considering the relationship between microbes and a disease manifestation. Although causal discovery in observational microbiome data faces many challenges, methodological advances in causal structure learning have improved the potential of data-driven prediction of causal effects in large-scale biological systems. In this Personal View, we show the capability of existing methods for inferring causal effects from metagenomic data, and we highlight ways in which the introduction of causal structures that are more flexible than existing structures offers new opportunities for causal reasoning. Our observations suggest that microbiome research can further benefit from tools developed in the past 5 years in causal discovery and learn from their applications elsewhere.},

abstract = {This study investigates the intricate interplay between social class, sex, and self-reported health (SRH) using data from the European Health Survey of Spain 2020 (EESE2020). Employing a cross-sectional design and a representative sample of 22,072 individuals, the analysis explores the persistence of disparities after adjusting for covariates, focusing on health-related variables. The study employs logistic regression models and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to delineate the direct effects of social class and sex on SRH, identifying a minimum adjustment set to control for confounding variables. Results reveal a gradient effect of social class on SRH, emphasizing the enduring impact of socioeconomic factors. Sex-based disparities in SRH diminish after considering additional health-related variables, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach. DAGs serve as transparent tools in disentangling complex relationships, guiding the identification of essential covariates. The study concludes that addressing health inequalities requires comprehensive strategies considering both individual health behaviours and socio-economic contexts. While recognizing limitations, such as the cross-sectional design, the findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of health disparities, informing evidence-based interventions and policies for a more equitable healthcare system.},

abstract = {Breastfeeding self-efficacy (BSE), defined as a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed, has been confirmed to predict the uptake of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Early experiences during the birth hospital stay, especially in-hospital formula feeding (IHFF), can impact both EBF and maternal breastfeeding confidence. Therefore, our objective was to examine the association between IHFF and EBF outcomes and investigate whether this association is influenced by BSE. The study included 778 infants from a larger cohort study conducted in 2021, with a one-year follow-up in rural areas of Sichuan Province, China. We used a causal mediation analysis to estimate the total effect (TE), natural direct (NDE), and nature indirect effects (NIE) using the paramed command in Stata. Causal mediation analyses revealed that IHFF was negatively associated with EBF (TE odds ratio = 0.47; 95{\%} CI, 0.29 to 0.76); 28{\%} of this association was mediated by BSE. In the subgroup analysis, there were no significant differences in the effects between parity subgroups, as well as between infant delivery subgroups. Our study found that IHFF hindered later EBF and that BSE mediated this association. Limiting the occurrence of in-hospital formula feeding or improving maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy is likely to improve exclusive breastfeeding outcomes.},

Participants were administered PROMIS support measures 1 month postpartum; the Perceived Stress and Postpartum Distress Measure 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum; and the CESD scale 12 months postpartum. Perceived stress was lower at 6 months postpartum for women reporting higher emotional ( p = 0.01), informational ( p = 0.03), and instrumental support ( p {\textless} 0.001); and lower at 12 months postpartum for women reporting higher emotional support ( p = 0.01). Distress at 6 months was lower in women reporting higher emotional support ( p = 0.03). Interactions suggest that associations were stronger for mothers that speak Spanish, spent fewer years in the U.S., and were born in Central America.},

abstract = {Clozapine is effective at reducing symptoms of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it can also induce several adverse outcomes including neutropenia and agranulocytosis. We used linear mixed-effect models and structural equation modelling to determine whether pharmacokinetic and genetic variables influence absolute neutrophil count in a longitudinal UK-based sample of clozapine users not currently experiencing neutropenia (N = 811). Increased daily clozapine dose was associated with elevated neutrophil count, amounting to a 133 cells/mm 3 rise per standard deviation increase in clozapine dose. One-third of the total effect of clozapine dose was mediated by plasma clozapine and norclozapine levels, which themselves demonstrated opposing, independent associations with absolute neutrophil count. Finally, CYP1A2 pharmacogenomic activity score was associated with absolute neutrophil count, supporting lower neutrophil levels in CYP1A2 poor metabolisers during clozapine use. This information may facilitate identifying at-risk patients and then introducing preventative interventions or individualised pharmacovigilance procedures to help mitigate these adverse haematological reactions.},

abstract = {Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease whose vaccine was introduced in England in 1988, however, Measles outbreaks have still been occurring in the country. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) removed the elimination status of Measles in 2019 from England and the whole United Kingdom. Noticeably, MMR vaccination coverage in England is below the recommended threshold with geographical variations across local authorities (LA). The research into the effect of income disparities on MMR vaccine coverage was insufficiently examined. Therefore, an ecological study will be conducted aiming at determining whether there is a relationship between income deprivation measures and MMR vaccine coverage in upper-tier local authorities in England. This study will be using 2019 publicly available vaccination data for children who were eligible for the MMR vaccine by their second and fifth birthday in 2018/2019. The effect of spatial clustering of income level on vaccination coverage will also be assessed. Vaccination coverage data will be obtained from “Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly (COVER)”. Income deprivation score, Deprivation gap, and Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index will be obtained from Office for National Statistics and Moran's Index will be generated using RStudio. Rural/urban LA classification and mothers' education will be included as possible confounding factors. Additionally, the live births rate per mothers' age group will be included as a proxy for the mothers' age variation in different LA. Multiple linear regression will be used after testing the relevant assumptions, using SPSS software. Moran's I together with income deprivation score will be analysed through regression and mediation analysis. This study will help in determining whether income level is a determinant of MMR vaccination uptake and coverage in LA in England which would help policymakers in designing targeted campaigns, thus preventing measles outbreaks in the future.},

@article{Guivarch2023,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Given inconsistent results in the literature, our objective was to examine the role of early parental feeding practices in children's growth. METHODS Analyses were based on 1245 children from the EDEN mother-child cohort. Parental feeding practices were assessed at the 2-year follow-up by using the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire. International Obesity Task Force BMI z-scores were derived from weight and height assessed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 years. Associations between parental feeding practices and child BMI z-scores at 4, 6 and 8 years were assessed by multivariable linear regressions, notably adjusted for 2-year BMI z-score. Analyses were stratified by child sex when relevant. Moreover, interaction and mediation analyses were respectively performed to assess whether parental feeding practices could moderate or mediate the associations between early and later growth. RESULTS For a given BMI z-score at 2 years, parental restriction for weight at 2 years was positively associated with child BMI z-scores from 4 to 8 years (at 8 years: $\beta$ [95{\%} CI] = 0.09 [0.01; 0.16]). Among boys only, high use of food as a reward was positively associated with later BMI z-scores (at 8 years: $\beta$ [95{\%} CI] = 0.15 [0.03; 0.27]). Parental feeding practices were not moderating factors in the associations between early and later growth. Parental restriction for weight was a mediating factor in the associations between 2-year BMI z-score and BMI z-scores up to 8 years (mediation: 2.69{\%} [0.27{\%}; 5.11{\%}] of the total effect at 8 years). CONCLUSIONS Restriction for weight reasons, often used by parents in response to the child's high appetite in infancy, appears to lie on the pathway between early and later BMI, but not restriction for health, suggesting that parental way of restricting the child's food intake matters.},
