Immunomodulation by early-life microbial exposure may influence neuropsychological function. In this study, we investigate the association between residential indoor microbiota and cognition and behavior among preschoolers. Results: Indoor-settled dust bacterial and fungal characteristics were assessed using 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing (microbial diversity) and qPCR measurements (microbial loads). Child behavior was assessed using four scales: peer relationship, emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Cognitive function was assessed using four tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) software. The first two tasks were designed to assess attention and psychomotor speed (Motor Screening (MOT) and Big/Little Circle (BLC)) and the last two to evaluate the child's visual recognition/working memory (Spatial Span (SSP) and Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS)). Among the 172 included children (age 4–6 years), we observed a 51% (95%CI;75%;9%) lower odds of children scoring not normal for hyperactivity and a decrease of 3.20% (95%CI, −6.01%; −0.30%) in BLC response time, for every IQR increase in fungal Shannon diversity. Contrarily, microbial loads were directly associated with SDQ scales and response time. For example, a 2-fold increase in Gram-positive bacterial load was associated with 70% (95%CI 18%; 156%) higher odds of scoring not normal for hyperactivity and an increase of 5.17% (95%CI 0.87%; 9.65%) in DMS response time. Conclusions: Our findings show that early-life exposure to diverse indoor fungal communities is associated with better behavioral and cognitive outcomes, whereas higher indoor microbial load was associated with worse outcomes.

The aim of this study was to describe the composition of the cultivated microbiota in dust samples collected in sport facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. A dust sample is defined as the airborne dust sedimented on 0.02 m2 within 28 d. The results show that the microbial viable counts in samples of airborne dust (n = 9) collected from seven Finnish sport facilities during the pandemic contained a high proportion of pathogenic filamentous fungi and a low proportion of bacteria. The microbial viable counts were between 14 CFU and 189 CFU per dust sample. In seven samples from sport facilities, 20–85% of the microbial viable counts were fungi. Out of 123 fungal colonies, 47 colonies belonged to the potentially pathogenic sections of Aspergillus (Sections Fumigati, Nigri, and Flavi). Representatives of each section were identified as Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger and A. tubingensis. Six colonies belonged to the genus Paecilomyces. In six samples of dust, a high proportion (50–100%) of the total fungal viable counts consisted of these potentially pathogenic fungi. A total of 70 isolates were considered less likely to be pathogenic, and were identified as Aspergillus section Nidulantes, Chaetomium cochliodes and Penicillium sp. In the rural (n = 2) and urban (n = 7) control dust samples, the microbial viable counts were >2000 CFU and between 44 CFU and 215 CFU, respectively, and consisted mainly of bacteria.

Both plastic and natural MFs were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Ultramicroscopic observation showed dense biofilms adhering on surfaces of MFs. Fallout MFs contained more bacteria but fewer fungi than MFs from AC filter dust. MFs-loaded bacteria were of highest abundance in living rooms, following dormitories and offices. Bacterial community and its diversity were further analyzed by 16S rRNA High-throughput sequencing. Up to 4540 of bacterium OTUs were shared in these MFs samples, unique OTUs in fallout and AC filter samples accounting for 26.3 % and 25.7 % of the total. Compared to MFs fallout, AC filter MFs contained more species of pathogenic bacteria, such as Betaproteobacteriales and Ralstonia, with obviously different β-diversity between two groups. Phenotypic analysis showed that fallout and AC filter MFs bacteria presented high index values of film formation, oxidative stress tolerance and potential pathogenicity.

Methods We collected classroom dust from 24 junior high schools in three geographically distanced areas in Malaysia (Johor Bahru, Terengganu and Penang), and conducted culture-independent high-throughput microbiome and untargeted metabolomics/chemical profiling. Results 1290 students were surveyed for asthma symptoms (wheeze). In each centre, we found significant variation in the prevalence of wheeze among schools, which could be explained by personal characteristics and air pollutants. Large-scale microbial variations were observed between the three centres; the potential protective bacteria were mainly from phyla Actinobacteria in Johor Bahru, Cyanobacteria in Terengganu and Proteobacteria in Penang. In total, 2633 metabolites and chemicals were characterised. Many metabolites were enriched in low-wheeze schools, including plant secondary metabolites flavonoids/isoflavonoids (isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, astragalin), indole and derivatives (indole, serotonin, 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde), and others (biotin, chavicol). A neural network analysis showed that the indole derivatives were co-occurring with the potential protective microbial taxa, including Actinomycetospora, Fischerella and Truepera, suggesting these microorganisms may pose health effects by releasing indole metabolites. A few synthetic chemicals were enriched in high-wheeze schools, including pesticides (2 (3H)-benzothiazolethione), fragrances (2-aminobenzoic acid, isovaleric acid), detergents and plastics (phthalic acid), and industrial materials (4,4-sulfonyldiphenol). Conclusions This is the first association study between high-throughput indoor chemical profiling and asthma symptoms.

Methods: 1,279 and 1,121 preschool children in an industrial city (Taiyuan) of China were assessed for asthma, rhinitis and eczema symptoms in 2012 and 2019 by self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Bacteria and fungi in classroom vacuum dust were characterized by culture-independent amplicon sequencing. Multi-level logistic/linear regression was performed in two cross-sectional and two combined models to assess the associations. Results: The number of observed species in bacterial and fungal communities in classrooms increased significantly from 2012 to 2019, and the compositions of the microbial communities were drastically changed (p < 0.001). The temporal microbiome variation was significantly larger than the spatial variation within the city (p < 0.001). Annual average outdoor SO2 concentration decreased by 60.7%, whereas NO2 and PM10 concentrations increased by 63.3% and 40.0% from 2012 to 2019, which were both associated with indoor microbiome variation (PERMANOVA p < 0.001). The prevalence of asthma (2.0% to 3.3%, p = 0.06) and rhinitis (28.0% to 25.3%, p = 0.13) were not significantly changed, but the prevalence of eczema was increased (3.6% to 7.0%; p < 0.001).

Microbial profiles were combined with extensive survey data on family structure, daily life, and physical characteristics of the home, as well as additional external environmental information, such as land use, and vegetational biodiversity near the home. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance we explained 18% of the variation of the relative abundance between samples within bacterial composition, and 17% of the fungal composition with the explanatory variables. The fungal community was dominated by the phyla Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota; the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were dominant. The presence of dogs, multiple children, and firewood were significantly associated with both the fungal and bacterial composition. Additionally, fungal communities were associated with land use, biodiversity in the area, and the type of building, while bacterial communities were associated with the human inhabitants and cleaning practices. A distinction emerged between members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, Ascomycota being more abundant in homes with greater surrounding natural environment, and potential contact with the environment.

However, the mechanism underlying the reduced allergies modulated by rural residency is unclear. Here, we assessed gut bacterial composition and metagenomics in urban and rural children in the EuroPrevall-INCO cohort. Airborne dusts, including mattress and rural henhouse dusts, were profiled for bacterial and fungal composition by amplicon sequencing. Mice were repeatedly exposed to intranasal dust extracts and evaluated for their effects on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation, and gut microbiota restoration was validated by fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from dust-exposed donor mice. We found that rural children had fewer allergies and unique gut microbiota with fewer Bacteroides and more Prevotella. Indoor dusts in rural environments harbored higher endotoxin level and diversity of bacteria and fungi, whereas indoor urban dusts were enriched with Aspergillus and contained elevated pathogenic bacteria. Intranasal administration of rural dusts before OVA sensitization reduced respiratory eosinophils and blood IgE level in mice and also led to a recovery of gut bacterial diversity and Ruminiclostridium in the mouse model. FMT restored the protective effect by reducing OVA-induced lung eosinophils in recipient mice. Together, these results support a cause-effect relationship between exposure to dust microbiota and allergy susceptibility in children and mice. Specifically, rural environmental exposure modulated the gut microbiota, which was essential in reducing allergy in children from Southern China. Our findings support the notion that the modulation of gut microbiota by exposure to rural indoor dust may improve allergy prevention.","2022-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"e2125733",NA,"1","14",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: yang2022a PMID: 36193874","yang2022a ",36193874,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA-seq and metagenomics; Allergies; Aspergillus; gut microbiota; indoor microbiota; urban/rural environments",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Respiratory outcomes, including physician-diagnosed asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitivity were assessed by physical examination and caregiver-report at ages seven and twelve. The associations between dust microbiota and respiratory outcomes were evaluated using Permanova, DESeq, and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models. Four types of WQS regression models were run to identify mixtures of fungi or bacteria that were associated with the absence or presence of health outcomes. For alpha or beta diversity of fungi and bacteria, no significant associations were found with respiratory health outcomes. DESeq identified specific bacterial and fungal indicator taxa that were higher or lower with the presence of different health outcomes. Most individual indicator fungal species were lower with asthma and wheeze and higher with aeroallergen positivity and rhinitis, whereas bacterial data was less consistent. WQS regression models demonstrated that a combination of species might influence health outcomes. Several heavily weighted species had a strong influence on the models, and therefore, created a microbial community that was associated with the absence or presence of asthma, wheeze, rhinitis, and aeroallergen+. Weights for specific species within WQS regression models supported indicator taxa findings. Health outcomes might be more influenced by the composition of a complex mixture of bacterial and fungal species in the indoor environment than by the absence or presence of individual species.

Identifying the drivers of these indoor microbial assemblages is key to controlling the microbiota of the built environment. In the present study, we used culture and metabarcoding of the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer ribosomal RNA region to assess whether small-scale variation in the built environment influences the diversity, composition and structure of indoor air fungal communities between a heating and an unheated season. Passive dust collectors were used to collect airborne fungi from 259 dwellings representative of three major building periods and five building environments in one city—Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland)—over a heating and an unheated period. A homogenous population (one or two people with an average age of 75 years) inhabited the households. Geographic information systems were used to assess detailed site characteristics (altitude, proximity to forest, fields and parks, proximity to the lake, and density of buildings and roads) for each building. Our analysis indicated that season was the factor that explained most of the variation in colonies forming unit (CFU) concentration and indoor mycobiome composition, followed by the period of building construction. Fungal assemblages were more diverse during the heating season than during the unheated season. Buildings with effective insulation had distinct mycobiome compositions from those built before 1975 — regardless of whether they were constructed with pre-1945 technology and materials or 1945 — 1974 ones. The urban landscape—as a whole—was a significant predictor of cultivable Penicillium load—the closer the building was to the lake, the higher the Penicillium load—but not of fungal community composition. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of eleven fungal taxa detected by metabarcoding decreased significantly with the urbanization gradient. When urban landscape descriptors were analyzed separately, the explanatory power of proximity to vegetation in shaping fungal assemblages become significant, indicating that land cover type had an influence on fungal community structure that was obscured by the effects of building age and sampling season. In conclusion, indoor mycobiomes are strongly modulated by season, and their assemblages are shaped by the effectiveness of building insulation, but are weakly influenced by the urban landscape.","2022-10","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"1045",NA,"10","8",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: niculita-hirzel2022a","niculita-hirzel2022a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"built environment; culture; indoor air quality; metabarcoding; urban mycobiome",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The microbiotas of EBC samples, with a substantial heterogeneity, were found to be as diverse as those of skin, floor dust, and airborne microbiotas.

Using a fast expectation-maximization algorithm, microbial community analysis revealed that expiratory microbiotas were differentially associated with other types of microbiotas in a type-dependent and residence-specific manner. Importantly, the expiratory bacteria showed a composition similarity with airborne bacteria in the bathroom and kitchen environments with an average of 12.60%, while the expiratory fungi showed a 53.99% composition similarity with the floor dust fungi. These differential patterns indicate different relationships between expiratory microbiotas and the airborne microbiotas and floor dust microbiotas.

Dwellings with three ventilation strategies (without mechanical ventilators, with heat recovery ventilators, and with energy recovery ventilators) were investigated before and after optimization of the ventilation systems. Indoor environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity) and microbiological parameters (total bacteria, Aspergillus/Penicillium, endotoxin, and microbial biodiversity) were measured. Dust samples were collected in closed face cassettes with a polycarbonate filter using a micro-vacuum while a volume of 20 m3 of bioaerosols were collected on filters using a SASS3100 (airflow of 300 L/min). In bioaerosols, the median number of copies was 4.01 × 103 copies/m3 of air for total bacteria and 1.45 × 101 copies/m3 for Aspergillus/Penicillium. Median concentrations were 5.13 × 104 copies/mg of dust, 5.07 × 101 copies/mg, 9.98 EU/mg for total bacteria, Aspergillus/Penicillium and endotoxin concentrations, respectively. The main microorganisms were associated with human occupancy such as skin-related bacteria or yeasts, regardless of the type of ventilation.","2021-11","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"2213–2225",NA,"6","31",NA,"Indoor Air",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: degois2021a PMID: 34048604","degois2021a ",34048604,NA,NA,NA,"bioaerosols; dwellings; indoor air quality; Nunavik; ventilation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated if THS-polluted homes differed in children's human and built-environment microbiomes as compared to THS-free homes. Methods: Participants were n = 19 THS-exposed children and n = 10 unexposed children (≤5 years) and their caregivers. Environmental and biological samples were analyzed for THS pollutants and exposure. Swab samples were collected from the built-environment (floor, table, armrest, bed frame) and child (finger, nose, mouth, and ear canal), and 16S ribosomal RNA genes were analyzed for bacterial taxa using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Results: Phylogenetic α-diversity was significantly higher for the built-environment microbiomes in THS-polluted homes compared to THS-free homes (p < 0.014). Log2-fold comparison found differences between THS-polluted and THS-free homes for specific genera in samples from the built-environment (e.g., Acinetobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Corynebacterium, Gemella, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Veillonella) and in samples from children (esp. Corynebacterium, Gemella, Lautropia, Neisseria, Rothia, Staphylococcus, and Veillonella). Conclusion: When exposed to THS, indoor and children microbiomes are altered in an environment-specific manner. Changes are similar to those reported in previous studies for smokers and secondhand smoke-exposed persons. THS-induced changes in child and built-environmental microbiomes may play a role in clinical outcomes in children. Impact: Despite smoking bans, children can be exposed to tobacco smoke residue (i.e., thirdhand smoke) that lingers on surfaces and in settled house dust.Thirdhand smoke exposure is associated with changes in the microbiomes of the home environment and of the children living in these homes.Thirdhand smoke is associated with increased phylogenetic diversity of the home environment and changes in the abundances of several genera of the child microbiome known to be affected by active smoking and secondhand smoke (e.g., Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus).Thirdhand smoke exposure by itself may induce alterations in the microbiome that play a role in childhood pathologies.","2021-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"1153–1160",NA,"6","90",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: kelley2021a PMID: 33654287","kelley2021a ",33654287,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At 6 and 18 months, the child was assessed for eczema by clinicians. In the eczema group, household environmental microbiota was characterized by presence of human‐associated bacteria Actinomyces , Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium at all time points, suggesting their possible contributions to regulating host immunity and increasing the susceptibility to eczema. In the home environment of the control group, putative protective effect of an environmental microbe Planomicrobium ( Planococcaceae family) was observed to be significantly higher than that in the eczema group. Network correlation analysis demonstrated inverse relationships between beneficial Planomicrobium and human‐associated bacteria ( Actinomyces , Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium ).

Here, we study the associations between nearby residential green space and residential indoor microbiota. Methods: We collected settled dust from 176 living rooms of participants of the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing, and quantitative PCR measurements of total bacterial and fungal loads to calculate bacterial and fungal diversity measures (Chao1 richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices) and relative abundance of individual taxa. Green spaces were estimated within 50m and 100m buffers around the residential address. We defined total residential green space using high-resolution land-cover data, further stratified in low-growing (height<3m) and high-growing green (height>3m). We used land-use data to calculate the residential nature. We ran linear regression models, adjusting for confounders and other potential determinants. Results are expressed as units change for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in residential green space and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: After adjustment, we observed statistically significant associations between the indoor microbial diversity indices and nearby residential green space. For bacteria, the Shannon index was directly associated with residential nature (e.g. 0.08 units increase (CI:0.02,0.13) per IQR increase in nature within a 50m buffer). Fungal diversity was directly associated with high-growing residential green and inversely with low-growing green. For example, an IQR increase in high-growing green within a 50m buffer was associated with increases in 0.14 (CI:0.01,0.27) and 0.02 (CI:0.008,0.04) units in the Shannon and Simpson indices, respectively. Conclusions: Nearby green space determines the diversity of indoor environment microbiota, and the type of green differently impacts bacterial and fungal diversity. Further research is needed to investigate in more detail possible microbial taxa compositions underlying the observed changes in indoor microbiota diversity and to explore their contribution to beneficial health effects associated with green space exposure.","2021-10","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"111543",NA,"","201",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: dockx2021a PMID: 34157273","dockx2021a ",34157273,NA,NA,NA,"Bacteria; Built environment; Fungi; Green space; Indoor environment",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to determine whether the indoor microbial diversity at early-life is associated with the development of allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy. Methods: The study population included children within two birth cohorts: Finnish rural-suburban LUKAS (N = 312), and German urban LISA from Munich and Leipzig study centers (N = 248). The indoor microbiota diversity (Chao1 richness and Shannon entropy) was characterized from floor dust samples collected at the child age of 2–3 months by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial and fungal DNA amplicons. Allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy were determined at the age of 10 years and analyzed using logistic regression models. Results: High bacterial richness (aOR 0.19, 95%CI 0.09–0.42 for middle and aOR 0.12, 95%CI 0.05–0.29 for highest vs. lowest tertile) and Shannon entropy were associated with lower risk of allergic rhinitis in LISA, and similar trend was seen in LUKAS. We observed some significant associations between bacterial and fungal diversity measured and the risk of inhalant atopy, but the associations were inconsistent between the two cohorts. High bacterial diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy in rural areas, but lower risk in more urban areas. Fungal diversity tended to be associated with increased risk of inhalant atopy only in LISA. Conclusions: Our study suggests that a higher bacterial diversity may reduce the risk of allergic rhinitis later in childhood. The environment-dependent heterogeneity in the associations with inhalant atopy – visible here as inconsistent results between two differing cohorts - suggests that specific constituents of the diversity may be relevant.","2021-05","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"110835",NA,"","196",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: hyytiaeinen2021a PMID: 33582132","hyytiaeinen2021a ",33582132,NA,NA,NA,"Allergic rhinitis; Indoor microbiota; Inhalant atopy; Microbial diversity",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increased knowledge about indoor mycobiomes from different regions of the world, and their main environmental determinants, will enable improved indoor air quality management and identification of health risks. This is the first citizen science study of indoor mycobiomes at a large geographical scale in Europe, including 271 houses from Norway and 807 dust samples from three house compartments: outside of the building, living room and bathroom. The fungal community composition determined by DNA metabarcoding was clearly different between indoor and outdoor samples, but there were no significant differences between the two indoor compartments. The 32 selected variables, related to the outdoor environment, building features and occupant characteristics, accounted for 15% of the overall variation in community composition, with the house compartment as the key factor (7.6%). Next, climate was the main driver of the dust mycobiomes (4.2%), while building and occupant variables had significant but minor influences (1.4% and 1.1%, respectively). The house‐dust mycobiomes were dominated by ascomycetes (⁓70%) with Capnodiales and Eurotiales as the most abundant orders. Compared to the outdoor samples, the indoor mycobiomes showed higher species richness, which is probably due to the mixture of fungi from outdoor and indoor sources.

We conducted a shotgun microbial metagenomic sequencing for vacuum dust collected in urban and rural schools in Shanxi province, China. SBS symptoms in students were surveyed, and microbial taxa and functional pathways related to the symptoms were identified using a multi-level linear regression model. SBS symptoms were common in students, and the prevalence of ocular and throat symptoms, headache, and tiredness was higher in urban than in rural areas (p < 0.05). A significant higher microbial α-diversity was found in rural areas than in urban areas (Chao1, p = 0.001; ACE, p = 0.002). Also, significant variation in microbial taxonomic and functional composition (β-diversity) was observed between urban and rural areas (p < 0.005). Five potential risk Actinobacteria species were associated with SBS symptoms (p < 0.01); students in the classrooms with a higher abundance of an unclassified Geodermatophilaceae, Geodermatophilus, Fridmanniella luteola, Microlunatus phosphovorus and Mycetocola reported more nasal and throat symptoms and tiredness. Students with a higher abundance of an unclassified flavobacteriaceae reported fewer throat symptoms and tiredness. The abundance of microbial metabolic pathways related to the synthesis of B vitamins (biotin and folate), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and peptidoglycan and were protectively (negatively) associated with SBS symptoms (FDR < 0.05).

We conducted an environmental assessment as part of an epidemiologic study of 50 elementary schools in a large city in the northeastern USA. We vacuumed dust from the edges of the floor in 500 classrooms accounting for 499 processed dust aliquots for 16S Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize bacterial assemblages. DNA sequences were organized into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and identified using a database derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Bacterial diversity and ecological analyses were performed at the genus level. We identified 29 phyla, 57 classes, 148 orders, 320 families, 1193 genera, and 2045 species in 3073 OTUs. The number of genera per school ranged from 470 to 705. The phylum Proteobacteria was richest of all while Firmicutes was most abundant. The most abundant order included Lactobacillales , Spirulinales , and Clostridiales . Halospirulina was the most abundant genus, which has never been reported from any school studies before. Gram-negative bacteria were more abundant and richer (relative abundance = 0.53; 1632 OTUs) than gram-positive bacteria (0.47; 1441). Outdoor environment-associated genera were identified in greater abundance in the classrooms, in contrast to homes where human-associated bacteria are typically more abundant. Effects of school location, degree of water damage, building condition, number of students, air temperature and humidity, floor material, and classroom's floor level on the bacterial richness or community composition were statistically significant but subtle, indicating relative stability of classroom microbiome from environmental stress. Our study indicates that classroom floor dust had a characteristic bacterial community that is different from typical house dust represented by more gram-positive and human-associated bacteria. Health implications of exposure to the microbiomes in classroom floor dust may be different from those in homes for school staff and students.","2021-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"15",NA,"1","9",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: park2021a PMID: 33472703","park2021a ",33472703,NA,NA,NA,"Bacteria; Classroom; Microbiome; Moisture damage; School",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the links between indoor microbial exposures and pulmonary microbial communities and to document the role of microbial exposures on inflammatory and clinical outcomes of patients with severe asthma (SA). Methods: A total of 55 patients with SA from the national Cohort of Bronchial Obstruction and Asthma cohort were enrolled for analyzing their indoor microbial flora through the use of electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs). Among these patients, 22 were able to produce sputum during “stable” or pulmonary “exacerbation” periods and had complete pairs of EDC and sputum samples, both collected and analyzed. We used amplicon targeted metagenomics to compare microbial communities from EDC and sputum samples of patients according to type 2 (T2)-asthma endotypes. Results: Compared with patients with T2-low SA, patients with T2-high SA exhibited an increase in bacterial α-diversity and a decrease in fungal α-diversity of their indoor microbial florae, the latter being significantly correlated with fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels.

Developing countries such as China have experienced rapid urbanization in past years, but no study has investigated microbiome exposure and urban-rural health effects in these countries. Methods: Nine high schools from urban and rural areas were randomly selected in Shanxi Province, China, and classroom vacuum dust was collected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A self-administered questionnaire was collected from 1332 students for personal information and health data. Three-level logistic regression was performed between microbial richness/abundance/functional pathways and the occurrence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms. Results: Consistent with developed countries, the prevalence of wheeze and rhinitis was higher in urban areas than in rural areas (p < 0.05). Metagenomic profiling revealed 8302 bacterial, 395 archaeal, 744 fungal, 524 protist and 1103 viral species in classroom dust. Actinobacteria (mean relative abundance 49.7%), Gammaproteobacteria (18.4%) and Alphaproteobacteria (10.0%) were the most abundant bacterial classes. The overall microbiome composition was significantly different between urban and rural schools (p = 0.001, Adonis). Species from Betaproteobactera, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli were enriched in urban schools, and species from Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were enriched in rural schools. Potential pathogens were present in higher abundance in urban schools than in rural schools (p < 0.05). Pseudoalteromonas, Neospora caninum and Microbacterium foliorum were positively associated with the occurrence of wheeze, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis, and Brachybacterium was protectively (negatively) associated with rhinitis (p < 0.01). The abundance of human endocrine and metabolic disease pathways was positively associated with rhinitis (p = 0.008), and butyrate and propionate metabolic genes and pathways were significantly enriched in rural schools (p < 0.005), in line with previous findings that these short-chain fatty acids protect against inflammatory diseases in the human gut. Conclusions: We conducted the first indoor microbiome survey in urban/rural environments with shotgun metagenomics, and the results revealed high-resolution microbial taxonomic and functional profiling and potential health effects.

The bacterial and fungal composition was characterized by sequencing 16s rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and the absolute microbial concentration was quantified by qPCR. In total, 326 bacterial and 255 fungal genera were characterized. Five bacterial (Sphingobium, Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia, Solirubrobacter, Pleurocapsa) and two fungal (Torulaspora and Leptosphaeriaceae) taxa were protective for asthma severity. Two bacterial taxa, Izhakiella and Robinsoniella, were positively associated with asthma severity. Several protective bacterial taxa including Rhodomicrobium, Shimwellia and Sphingobium have been reported as protective microbes in previous studies, whereas other taxa were first time reported. Environmental characteristics, such as age of building, size of textile curtain per room volume, occurrence of cockroaches, concentration of house dust mite allergens transferred from homes by the occupants, were involved in shaping the overall microbial community but not asthma-associated taxa; whereas visible dampness and mold, which did not change the overall microbial community for floor dust, was negatively associated with the concentration of protective bacteria Rhodomicrobium (β = −2.86, p = 0.021) of asthma. The result indicates complex interactions between microbes, environmental characteristics and asthma symptoms.

Among microbiological contaminants, bacterial and fungal aerosols remain poorly studied and the debate on the impact of these aerosols on respiratory health is still open. This study aimed to assess the diversity of indoor microbial communities in relationship with the health of occupants. Methods: Measurements were taken from dwellings of 2 cohorts in Brittany (France), one with children without any pathology and the other with children and adults with asthma. Thirty dust samples were analyzed by next generation sequencing with a 16S and 18S targeted metagenomics approach. Analysis of sequencing data was performed using qiime 2, and univariate and multivariate statistical analysis using R software and phyloseq package. Results: A total of 2,637 prokaryotic (589 at genus level) and 2,153 eukaryotic taxa were identified (856 fungal taxa (39%) and 573 metazoa (26%)). The four main bacterial phyla were identified: Proteobacteria (53%), Firmicutes (27%), Actinobacteria (11%), Bacteroidetes (8%). Among Fungi, only 136 taxa were identified at genus level. Three main fungal phyla were identified: Ascomycota (84%), Basidiomycota (12%) and Mucoromycota (3%). No bacterial nor fungal phyla were significantly associated with asthma versus control group. A significant over representation in control group versus asthma was observed for Christensenellaceae family (p-value = 0.0015, adj. p-value = 0.033). Besides, a trend for over representation in control group was observed with Dermabacteraceae family (p-value = 0.0002, adj. p-value = 0.815). Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that dust samples harbor a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and fungi. Molecular methods such as next generation sequencing are reliable tools for identifying and tracking the bacterial and fungal diversity in dust samples, a less easy strategy for the detection of eukaryotes at least using18S metagenomics approach.

The microbial communities of bed bug-infested homes were radically different from those of uninfested homes, and the bed bug endosymbiont Wolbachia was the major driver of this difference. After bed bugs were eliminated, the microbial community gradually shifted toward the community composition of uninfested homes, strongly implicating bed bugs in shaping the dust-associated environmental microbiome.

Here, the environmental microbiota may be of particular interest as it represents the interface between environmental factors and the child. As infants in modern societies spend a considerable amount of time indoors, we hypothesize that the indoor bed dust microbiota might be an important factor for the child and for the early colonization of the airway microbiome. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the influence of environmental exposures on 577 dust samples from the beds of infants together with 542 airway samples from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 cohort. Results: Both bacterial and fungal community was profiled from the bed dust. Bacterial and fungal diversity in the bed dust was positively correlated with each other. Bacterial bed dust microbiota was influenced by multiple environmental factors, such as type of home (house or apartment), living environment (rural or urban), sex of siblings, and presence of pets (cat and/or dog), whereas fungal bed dust microbiota was majorly influenced by the type of home (house or apartment) and sampling season. We further observed minor correlation between bed dust and airway microbiota compositions among infants. We also analyzed the transfer of microbiota from bed dust to the airway, but we did not find evidence of transfer of individual taxa. Conclusions: Current study explores the influence of environmental factors on bed dust microbiota (both bacterial and fungal) and its correlation with airway microbiota (bacterial) in early life using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings demonstrate that bed dust microbiota is influenced by multiple environmental exposures and could represent an interface between environment and child.

However, the biogeography of the indoor microbial community is still inadequately studied. Dust from more than 3000 dwellings across France was analyzed by qPCR using 17 targets: 10 molds, 3 bacteria groups, and 4 mites. Thus, the first spatial description of the main indoor microbial allergens on the French territory, in relation with biogeographical factors influencing the distribution of microorganisms, was realized in this study. Ten microorganisms out of 17 exhibited increasing abundance profiles across the country: Five microorganisms (Dermatophagoïdes pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoïdes spp., Streptomyces spp., Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Epicoccum nigrum) from northeast to southwest, two (Cryptococcus spp., Alternaria alternata) from northwest to southeast, Mycobacteria from east to west, Aspergillus fumigatus from south to north, and Penicillium chrysogenum from south to northeast. These geographical patterns were partly linked to climate and land cover. Multivariate analysis showed that composition of communities seemed to depend on landscapes, with species related to closed and rather cold and humid landscapes (forests, located in the northeast) and others to more open, hot, and dry landscapes (herbaceous and coastal regions, located in the west). This study highlights the importance of geographical location and outdoor factors that shape communities. In order to study the effect of microorganisms on human health (allergic diseases in particular), it is important to identify biogeographic factors that structure microbial communities on large spatial scales and to quantify the exposure with quantitative tools, such as the multi-qPCR approach.","2020-02","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"341",NA,"3","8",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: rocchi2020a","rocchi2020a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bacteria; Dust mites; Electrostatic dust collector; Indoor exposure; Molds; QPCR",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities were quantified from homes within the Cherokee Nation in North Eastern, Oklahoma, USA, where seasonal air exchange rates (AERs) were measured, and seasonal outdoor and indoor air, floor dust, and settled dust samples were collected. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and DNA amplicon sequencing were paired with a mass balance model to determine if high and low ventilation rate regimes impacted bacterial and fungal concentration and community structure, and to estimate the relative contributions of microbiota to indoor air from infiltration of outdoor air (ventilation) versus indoor emissions. For indoor PM10 and settled dusts samples, comparative analyses of microbial communities revealed no significant bacterial or fungal community differences between samples taken from homes dichotomized into high (average high AER = 0.56 hr−1) and low (average low AER = 0.16 hr−1) AER regimes (p > 0.1 for all), suggesting that ventilation was not a significant factor controlling bacterial and fungal concentrations and ecologies in the indoor air of these homes. A comparison between indoor emissions (typically due to occupancy and resuspension) and ventilation (infiltration of outdoor air) as a source of bacteria and fungi indicates that indoor emissions are the dominant source of particulate matter, bacteria, and fungi, accounting for  ̃94% indoor air PM10,  ̃97% of indoor air bacteria, and  ̃91% of indoor air fungi. Thus, indoor emission sources must be controlled to significantly impact human bacterial and fungal (allergen) exposure in the indoor air of these residential environments.","2020-06","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"106800",NA,"","177",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: kwan2020a","kwan2020a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Microbiome; Single family home; Ventilation",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, it has been found that bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) within indoor dust particles can induce pulmonary inflammation, suggesting that these might play a role in lung disease. Methods: We performed microbiome analysis of indoor dust EVs isolated from mattresses in apartments and hospitals. We developed diagnostic models based on the bacterial EVs antibodies detected in serum samples via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in this analysis. Results: Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial EV taxa observed at the phylum level while Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae (f) and Acinetobacter were the most prominent organisms at the genus level, followed by Staphylococcus. Based on the microbiome analysis, serum anti-bacterial EV immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1 and IgG4 were analyzed using ELISA with EV antibodies that targeted Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The levels of anti-bacterial EV antibodies were found to be significantly higher in patients with asthma, COPD and lung cancer compared to the healthy control group. We then developed a diagnostic model through logistic regression of antibodies that showed significant differences between groups with smoking history as a covariate. Four different variable selection methods were compared to construct an optimal diagnostic model with area under the curves ranging from 0.72 to 0.81. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ELISA-based analysis of anti-bacterial EV antibodies titers can be used as a diagnostic tool for lung disease. The present findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of lung disease as well as a foundation for developing a novel diagnostic methodology that synergizes microbial EV metagenomics and immune assays.","2020","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"669–683",NA,"4","12",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: yang2020a","yang2020a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Asthma; Bacteria; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Diagnosis; Dust; Extracellular vesicles; Lung neoplasms; microbiome",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The sampling device captured sufficient microbial material to enable 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data to be generated for every sample in the study. Neither the presence of HEPA filters nor the height at which the air sampling device was placed had any influence on the microbial community profile. A core microbiota of 31 OTUs was present in more than three quarters of the samples, comprising around 45% of the relative sequence counts in each bedroom. The most abundant single organisms were Staphylococcus, with other core taxa both human and outdoor-associated. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly increased in bedrooms that reported having open windows, those with flowering plants in the vicinity, and those in homes occupied by dogs. Porphyromonas, Moraxella, Sutterella, and Clostridium, along with family Neisseraceae, were significantly enriched in homes with dogs; interestingly, cats did not show a significant impact on microbial diversity or relative abundance. While dog allergen load was significantly correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, the taxa that significantly correlated with allergen burden did not exclusively overlap with those enriched in homes with dogs. Alternaria allergen load was positively correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, while Aspergillus allergen load was negatively correlated. The Alternaria allergen load was also significantly correlated with open windows. Microbial communities were significantly differentiated between rural, suburban, and urban homes and houses that were physically closer to each other maintained significantly more similar microbiota.

The protective microbiota had a low abundance of Streptococcaceae relative to outdoor-associated bacterial taxa. The protective effect was independent of richness and total bacterial load and was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine responses against bacterial cell wall components ex vivo. We were able to reproduce these findings in a study among rural German children2 and showed that children living in German non-farm homes with an indoor microbiota more similar to Finnish farm homes have decreased asthma risk.

Objective: We sought to determine whether individual bacterial genera in indoor microbiota predict the development of asthma. Methods: Dust samples from living rooms were collected at 2 months of age. The dust microbiota was characterized by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing amplicons of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Children (n = 373) were followed up for ever asthma until the age of 10.5 years. Results: Richness was inversely associated with asthma after adjustments (P = .03). The phylogenetic microbiota composition in asthmatics patients' homes was characteristically different from that in nonasthmatic subjects' homes (P = .02, weighted UniFrac, adjusted association, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, PERMANOVA-S). The first 2 axis scores of principal coordinate analysis of the weighted UniFrac distance matrix were inversely associated with asthma. Of 658 genera detected in the dust samples, the relative abundances of 41 genera correlated (r > |0.4|) with one of these axes. Lactococcus genus was a risk factor for asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13-1.63] per interquartile range change). The abundance of 12 bacterial genera (mostly from the Actinomycetales order) was associated with lower asthma risk (P < .10), although not independently of each other. The sum relative abundance of these 12 intercorrelated genera was significantly protective and explained the majority of the association of richness with less asthma.

Resuspension of floor dust and its impact on infant microbial exposure is, however, little explored. The aim of our study was to investigate how floor dust resuspension induced by an infant's crawling motion and an adult walking affects infant inhalation exposure to microbes. Results: We conducted controlled chamber experiments with a simplified mechanical crawling infant robot and an adult volunteer walking over carpeted flooring. We applied bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR to monitor the infant breathing zone microbial content and compared that to the adult breathing zone and the carpet dust as the source. During crawling, fungal and bacterial levels were, on average, 8-to 21-fold higher in the infant breathing zone compared to measurements from the adult breathing zone. During walking experiments, the increase in microbial levels in the infant breathing zone was far less pronounced. The correlation in rank orders of microbial levels in the carpet dust and the corresponding infant breathing zone sample varied between different microbial groups but was mostly moderate. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa was characteristically distinct in carpet dust and infant and adult breathing zones during the infant crawling experiments. Bacterial diversity in carpet dust and the infant breathing zone did not correlate significantly. Conclusions: The microbiota in the infant breathing zone differ in absolute quantitative and compositional terms from that of the adult breathing zone and of floor dust. Crawling induces resuspension of floor dust from carpeted flooring, creating a concentrated and localized cloud of microbial content around the infant. Thus, the microbial exposure of infants following dust resuspension is difficult to predict based on common house dust or bulk air measurements. Improved approaches for the assessment of infant microbial exposure, such as sampling at the infant breathing zone level, are needed.","2018-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"25",NA,"1","6",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: hyytiaeinen2018a PMID: 29394954","hyytiaeinen2018a ",29394954,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA gene sequencing; Indoor microbial exposure; Infant exposure; Particle resuspension; QPCR",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Microbiota composition and taxa (V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) were compared between homes that did and did not adopt a dog. A total of 91 dust samples from 54 families (27 each, dog and no dog; 17 dog and 20 no dog homes with paired samples) were analyzed. A significant dog effect was seen across time in both unweighted UniFrac and Canberra metrics (both P =.008), indicating dog introduction may result in rapid establishment of rarer and phylogenetically related taxa. A significant dog-time interaction was seen in both weighted UniFrac (P <.001) and Bray-Curtis (P =.002) metrics, suggesting that while there may not initially be large relative abundance shifts following dog introduction, differences can be seen within a year. Therefore, dog introduction into the home has both immediate effects and effects that emerge over time.","2018-07","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"539–547",NA,"4","28",NA,"Indoor Air",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: sitarik2018a PMID: 29468742","sitarik2018a ",29468742,NA,NA,NA,"allergy; asthma; dog; hygiene hypothesis; microbiome; microbiota hypothesis",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is known about how farming exposures impact the indoor microbiota. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify exposures related to bacterial communities in house dust in a U.S. farming population. METHODS: We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in vacuumed dust samples from the bedrooms of a subset of 879 households of farmers and farmers' spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study (ALHS), a case–control study of asthma nested within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) in North Carolina and Iowa. Information on current farming (past 12 mo), including both crop and animal farming, and other potential microbial sources was obtained via questionnaires. We used linear regression to evaluate associations between exposures and bacterial diversity within each sample, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to identify exposures related to diversity between samples, and analysis of composition of microbiome to examine whether exposures related to diversity were also related to differential abundance of specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs). RESULTS: Current farming was positively associated with bacterial diversity in house dust, with or without adjustment for nonfarm exposures related to diversity, including presence of indoor pets, home condition, and season of dust collection. Many taxa exhibited differential abundance related to farming. Some taxa in the phyla Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia were associated [false discovery rate FDR < 0:05] with farming but not with other nonfarm factors. Many taxa correlated with the concentration of house dust of endotoxin, commonly studied as a general marker of exposure to the farming environment. CONCLUSIONS: In this farming population, house dust microbiota differed by current farming status. Understanding the determinants of the indoor microbiota is the first step toward understanding potential relationships with health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3145","2018-06","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"67001",NA,"6","126",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: lee2018a PMID: 29863827","lee2018a ",29863827,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bacterial DNA samples were collected from restrooms and halls of a three-floor building from the Federal University of Pampa, RS, Brazil. The bacterial community was characterized by amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing. Throughout all samples, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Beta diversity metrics showed that the structure of the bacterial communities were different among the areas and floors tested, however, only 6–9% of the variation in bacterial communities was explained by the area and floors sampled. A few microorganisms showed significantly differential abundance between men's and women's restrooms, but in general, the bacterial communities from both places were very similar.

The transmission of sunlight through windows is a key building design consideration, but the effects of light exposure on dust communities remain unclear. We report results of an experiment and computational models designed to assess the effects of light exposure and wavelengths on the structure of the dust microbiome. Specifically, we placed household dust in replicate model ""rooms"" with windows that transmitted visible, ultraviolet, or no light and measured taxonomic compositions, absolute abundances, and viabilities of the resulting bacterial communities. Results: Light exposure per se led to lower abundances of viable bacteria and communities that were compositionally distinct from dark rooms, suggesting preferential inactivation of some microbes over others under daylighting conditions. Differences between communities experiencing visible and ultraviolet light wavelengths were relatively minor, manifesting primarily in abundances of dead human-derived taxa. Daylighting was associated with the loss of a few numerically dominant groups of related microorganisms and apparent increases in the abundances of some rare groups, suggesting that a small number of microorganisms may have exhibited modest population growth under lighting conditions. Although biological processes like population growth on dust could have generated these patterns, we also present an alternate statistical explanation using sampling models from ecology; simulations indicate that artefactual, apparent increases in the abundances of very rare taxa may be a null expectation following the selective inactivation of dominant microorganisms in a community. Conclusions: Our experimental and simulation-based results indicate that dust contains living bacterial taxa that can be inactivated following changes in local abiotic conditions and suggest that the bactericidal potential of ordinary window-filtered sunlight may be similar to ultraviolet wavelengths across dosages that are relevant to real buildings.","2018-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"175",NA,"1","6",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: fahimipour2018b PMID: 30333051","fahimipour2018b ",30333051,NA,NA,NA,"Built environment; Daylight; Dust; Microbiome",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors was evaluated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Meanwhile, differences in the pathogenic bacteria between bioaerosols and dust in a typical hospital was investigated. Furthermore, cultivable Staphylococcus isolates with multi-drug resistance phenotype (>3 antibiotics) in the inpatient departments were much higher than those in the transfusion area and out-patient departments, possibly attributed to the dense usage of antibiotics in inpatient departments.

Analysis indicated that there was no clear trend in the fungal communities between green and non-green homes. Instead, fungal community differences were greatest between sample types - air, bed, and floor. Microbial communities also changed substantially between sampling intervals in both green and non-green homes for all sample types, potentially indicating that there was very little stability in the mycobiomes.

At the genus level, about 30% of sequences from the exhaust filter were classified as bacteria of probable human origin, such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species.

The objectives of this current study were (i) to characterize fungal and bacterial microbiota in house dust of severely moisture-damaged residences, (ii) to identify microbial taxa associated with moisture damage renovations, and (iii) to test whether the associations between the identified taxa and moisture damage are replicable in another cohort of homes. We applied bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing complemented with quantitative PCR and chemical-analytical approaches to samples of house dust, and also performed traditional cultivation of bacteria and fungi from building material samples. RESULTS: Active microbial growth on building materials had significant though small influence on the house dust bacterial and fungal communities. Moisture damage interventions-including actual renovation of damaged homes and cases where families moved to another home-had only a subtle effect on bacterial community structure, seen as shifts in abundance weighted bacterial profiles after intervention. While bacterial and fungal species richness were reduced in homes that were renovated, they were not reduced for families that moved houses. Using different discriminant analysis tools, we were able identify taxa that were significantly reduced in relative abundance during renovation of moisture damage. For bacteria, the majority of candidates belonged to different families within the Actinomycetales order. Results for fungi were overall less consistent. A replication study in approximately 400 homes highlighted some of the identified taxa, confirming associations with observations of moisture damage and mold. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is one of the first studies to analyze changes in microbiota due to moisture damage interventions using high-throughput sequencing. Our results suggest that effects of moisture damage and moisture damage interventions may appear as changes in the abundance of individual, less common, and especially bacterial taxa, rather than in overall community structure.","2017-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"138",NA,"1","5",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: jayaprakash2017a PMID: 29029638","jayaprakash2017a ",29029638,NA,NA,NA,"Amplicon sequencing; Built environment; Dampness; House dust microbiota; Indoor; Indoor mold; Intervention; Moisture damage",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dust samples from a mixed-use athletic and educational facility were subjected to microbial and chemical analyses using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The dust resistome was characterized by identifying antibiotic resistance genes annotated in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) from the metagenomes of each sample using the Short, Better Representative Extract Data set (ShortBRED). The three most highly abundant antibiotic resistance genes were tet(W), blaSRT-1, and erm(B). The complete dust resistome was then compared against the measured concentrations of antimicrobial chemicals, which for triclosan ranged from 0.5 to 1970 ng/g dust. We observed six significant positive associations between the concentration of an antimicrobial chemical and the relative abundance of an antibiotic resistance gene, including one between the ubiquitous antimicrobial triclosan and erm(X), a 23S rRNA methyltransferase implicated in resistance to several antibiotics.

Objective We sought to examine associations between exposures to household microbes and childhood asthma severity stratified by atopic status. Methods Participants (n = 196) were selected from a cohort of asthmatic children in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Children were grouped according to asthma severity (mild with no or minimal symptoms and medication or moderate to severe persistent) and atopic status (determined by serum IgE levels). Microbial community structure and concentrations in house dust were determined by using next-generation DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between asthma severity and exposure metrics, including richness, taxa identification and quantification, community composition, and concentration of total fungi and bacteria. Results Among all children, increased asthma severity was significantly associated with an increased concentration of summed allergenic fungal species, high total fungal concentrations, and high bacterial richness by using logistic regression in addition to microbial community composition by using the distance comparison t test. Asthma severity in atopic children was associated with fungal community composition (P = .001). By using logistic regression, asthma severity in nonatopic children was associated with total fungal concentration (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.06-5.44). The fungal genus Volutella was associated with increased asthma severity in atopic children (P = .0001, q = 0.04).

Therefore, we wanted to identify key environmental determinants for the house dust microbiome from an existing collection of spatially (area of Munich, Germany) and temporally (301 days) distributed samples and to determine changes in the community as a function of time. To that end, dust samples that had been collected once from the living room floors of 286 individual households, were profiled for fungal and bacterial community variation and diversity using microbial fingerprinting techniques. The profiles were tested for their association with occupant behaviour, building characteristics, outdoor pollution, vegetation, and urbanization. Our results showed that more environmental and particularly outdoor factors (vegetation, urbanization, airborne particulate matter) affected the community composition of indoor fungi than of bacteria. The passage of time affected fungi and, surprisingly, also strongly affected bacteria. We inferred that fungal communities in indoor dust changed semi-annually, whereas bacterial communities paralleled outdoor plant phenological periods.

Our goal was to identify some of the factors that determine the richness, evenness and diversity of the home's fungal and bacterial microbiomes. Method: Vacuumed settled dust from homes (n=35) in Cincinnati, OH, were analyzed by pyrosequencing to determine the fungal and bacterial relative sequence occurrence. The correlation coefficients between home environmental characteristics, including age of home, Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values, occupant number, relative humidity and temperature, as well as pets (dog and cat) were evaluated for their influence on fungal and bacterial communities. In addition, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for identifying fungal and bacterial genera and species associated with those housing determinants found to be significant. Results: The fungal richness was found to be positively correlated with age of home (p=0.002), ERMI value (p=0.003), and relative humidity (p=0.015) in the home. However, fungal evenness and diversity were only correlated with the age of home (p=0.001). Diversity and evenness (not richness) of the bacterial microbiome in the homes were associated with dog ownership.Linear discriminant analysis showed total of 39 putative fungal genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in high ERMI homes and 47 genera/species with significantly higher LDA scores in homes with high relative humidity. When categorized according to the age of the home, a total of 67 fungal genera/species had LDA scores above the significance threshold. Dog ownership appeared to have the most influence on the bacterial microbiome, since a total of 130 bacterial genera/species had significantly higher LDA scores in homes with dogs.

Here we report on a preliminary investigation of the associations between bacteria in house dust and the nascent fecal microbiota from 20 subjects from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study using high-throughput sequence analysis of portions of the 16S rRNA gene. Despite significant differences between the dust and fecal microbiota revealed by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis, permutation analysis confirmed that 14 bacterial OTUs representing the classes Actinobacteria (3), Bacilli (3), Clostridia (6) and Gammaproteobacteria (2) co-occurred at a significantly higher frequency in matched dust-stool pairs than in randomly permuted pairs, indicating an association between these dust and stool communities. These associations could indicate a role for the indoor environment in shaping the nascent gut microbiota, but future studies will be needed to confirm that our findings do not solely reflect a reverse pathway.

In contrast, when ERMI values of 2011 were considered, Gram-negative bacteria determined with QPCR in air, endotoxin in air, and muramic acid in dust were significantly greater in high ERMI homes. The results suggest that both short-term and long-term mold contamination in homes could be linked with the bacterial concentrations in house dust, however, only the current mold status was associated with bacterial concentrations in air. Although correlations were found between endotoxin and Gram-negative bacteria as well as between muramic acid and Gram-positive bacteria in the entire data set, diverging associations were observed between the different measures of bacteria and the home moldiness. It is likely that concentrations of cells obtained by QPCR and concentrations of cell wall components are not equivalent and represent too broad categories to understand the bacterial composition and sources of the home microbiota. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014-06","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"92–99",NA,"1","482-483",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: adhikari2014a PMID: 24642096","adhikari2014a ",24642096,NA,NA,NA,"Bacteria; Endotoxin; ERMI; Indoor air quality; Mold; Muramic acid",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study we combined microbiological data with information on the function, form, and organization of spaces from a classroom and office building to understand how design choices influence the biogeography of the built environment microbiome. Results: Sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene from dust samples revealed that indoor bacterial communities were extremely diverse, containing more than 32,750 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, 97% sequence similarity cutoff), but most communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Deinococci. Architectural design characteristics related to space type, building arrangement, human use and movement, and ventilation source had a large influence on the structure of bacterial communities. Restrooms contained bacterial communities that were highly distinct from all other rooms, and spaces with high human occupant diversity and a high degree of connectedness to other spaces via ventilation or human movement contained a distinct set of bacterial taxa when compared to spaces with low occupant diversity and low connectedness. Within offices, the source of ventilation air had the greatest effect on bacterial community structure. Conclusions: Our study indicates that humans have a guiding impact on the microbial biodiversity in buildings, both indirectly through the effects of architectural design on microbial community structure, and more directly through the effects of human occupancy and use patterns on the microbes found in different spaces and space types. The impact of design decisions in structuring the indoor microbiome offers the possibility to use ecological knowledge to shape our buildings in a way that will select for an indoor microbiome that promotes our health and well-being. © 2014 Kembel et al.","2014-01","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"e87093",NA,"1","9",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: kembel2014a PMID: 24489843","kembel2014a ",24489843,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"White, Bryan A.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To this end, pyrosequencing was used to delineate the fungal and bacterial communities recovered from six samplers placed in an occupied retail building over two consecutive sampling events spaced one week apart.

We surveyed airborne fungal assemblages within 1-month time periods at two seasons, with high replication, indoors and outdoors, within and across standardized residences at a university housing facility. Fungal assemblages indoors were diverse and strongly determined by dispersal from outdoors, and no fungal taxa were found as indicators of indoor air. There was a seasonal effect on the fungi found in both indoor and outdoor air, and quantitatively more fungal biomass was detected outdoors than indoors. A strong signal of isolation by distance existed in both outdoor and indoor airborne fungal assemblages, despite the small geographic scale in which this study was undertaken (<500 m). Moreover, room and occupant behavior had no detectable effect on the fungi found in indoor air. These results show that at the local level, outdoor air fungi dominate the patterning of indoor air.

Dust was allowed to passively settle in five common locations around a home - living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and balcony - at different dwellings within a university-housing complex for a one-month period at two time points, once in summer and again in winter. We amplified the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in these samples and analyzed them with high-throughput sequencing. Like fungal OTU-richness, bacterial OTU-richness was higher outdoors then indoors and was invariant across different indoor room types. While fungal composition was structured largely by season and residential unit, bacterial composition varied by residential unit and room type. Bacteria from putative outdoor sources, such as Sphingomonas and Deinococcus, comprised a large percentage of the balcony samples, while human-associated taxa comprised a large percentage of the indoor samples. Abundant outdoor bacterial taxa were also observed indoors, but the reverse was not true; this is unlike fungi, in which the taxa abundant indoors were also well-represented outdoors. Moreover, there was a partial association of bacterial composition and geographic distance, such that samples separated by even a few hundred meters tended have greater compositional differences than samples closer together in space, a pattern also observed for fungi. These data show that while the outdoor source for indoor bacteria and fungi varies in both space and time, humans provide a strong and homogenizing effect on indoor bacterial bioaerosols, a pattern not observed in fungi. © 2014 Adams et al.","2014-03","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"e91283",NA,"3","9",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: adams2014a PMID: 24603548","adams2014a ",24603548,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"Moreau, Corrie S.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ninety-eight children under the age of five years hospitalized with LRTI were recruited and matched by age (±3 months), sex, and geographical location to 99 community-based controls without LRTI. Participants' homes were visited and sampled over a 14-day period for airborne house dust using electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDC). In airborne dust samples, the composition of bacterial and fungal communities was characterized by a meta-barcoding approach using amplicons targeting simultaneously the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the internal-transcribed-spacer (ITS) region-1 of fungi in association with the SILVA and UNITE database respectively.

However, there is a turnover of microbial communities on shoe soles during walking. The impact of microbial community turnover on tracing recent geolocation from shoe soles has not been adequately studied. In addition, it is still unclear whether the microbiota of shoeprints can be used to determine recent geolocation. In this preliminary study, we investigated whether the microbial characteristics of shoe soles and shoeprints can be used to trace geolocation and whether this information can be destroyed by walking on indoor floors. In this study, participants were asked to walk outdoors on exposed soil, then walk indoors on a hard wood floor. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to characterize the microbial communities of shoe soles, shoeprints, indoor dust, and outdoor soil. Samples of shoe soles and shoeprints were collected at steps 5, 20, and 50 while walking indoors. The PCoA result showed that the samples were clustered by geographic origin. The shoeprint showed a more rapid turnover of microbial community than the shoe sole during indoor walking. The result of FEAST showed that the microbial communities of shoe sole and shoeprint were mainly (shoe sole, 86.21∼92.34 %; shoeprint, 61.66∼90.41 %) from the soil of the outdoor ground where the individual recently walked, and a small portion (shoe sole, 0.68∼3.33 %; shoeprint, 1.43∼27.14 %) from the indoor dust. Based on the matching of microbial communities between geolocation and shoe sole or shoeprint, we were able to infer the recent geolocation of the individual with relatively high accuracy using the random forest prediction model (shoe sole: 100.00 %, shoeprint: 93.33∼100.00 %). Overall, we are able to accurately infer the geolocation of an individual's most recent outdoor walk based on the microbiota of shoe sole and shoeprint, even though these microbiotas show a turnover when walking indoor floor.

We examined various farm-related exposures, including living on a farm, crop versus animal production, and type of animal production, as well as non-farm exposures, including home cleanliness and indoor pets. We assessed the association of the exposures on within-sample alpha diversity and between-sample beta diversity, and the differential abundance of specific microbes by exposure. Results were compared to previous findings using 16S. We found most farm exposures were significantly positively associated with both alpha and beta diversity. Many microbes exhibited differential abundance related to farm exposures, mainly in the phyla Actinobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria . The identification of novel differential taxa associated with farming at the genera level, including Rhodococcus , Bifidobacterium , Corynebacterium , and Pseudomonas , was a benefit of WGS compared to 16S. Our findings indicate that characterization of dust microbiota, an important component of the indoor environment relevant to human health, is heavily influenced by sequencing techniques. WGS is a powerful tool to survey the microbial community that provides novel insights on the impact of environmental exposures on indoor dust microbiota. These findings can inform the design of future studies in environmental health.","2023-06","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"1202194",NA,"","14",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: wang2023a","wang2023a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"agricultural health study; environmental microbiology; farming environmental exposures; home dust microbiota; indoor microbiome; whole genome sequencing",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Airborne dust particles were sampled with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs) from the participants' bedrooms. The dust washed from the EDCs' clothes was used to extract DNA and endotoxin. The DNA extracts were used for quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) measurement and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while endotoxin was measured using the kinetic chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. The results showed that households in Tartu and Aarhus had a higher bacterial load and diversity than those in Bergen and Reykjavik, possibly due to elevated concentrations of outdoor bacterial taxa associated with low precipitation and high wind speeds. Bergen-Tartu had the highest difference (ANOSIM R = 0.203) in β diversity. Multivariate regression models showed that α diversity indices and bacterial and endotoxin loads were positively associated with the occupants' age, number of occupants, cleaning frequency, presence of dogs, and age of the house.

We aimed to characterize the changes in human nasopharyngeal bacteriome after short-term exposure to indoor (workplace) environments. Methods: In this pilot study, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 22 participants in the morning and after 8 h of their presence at the workplace. At the same time points, indoor dust samples were collected from the participants' households (16 from flats and 6 from houses) and workplaces (8 from a maternity hospital – NEO, 6 from a pediatric hospital – ENT, and 8 from a research center – RCX). 16S rRNA sequencing analysis was performed on these human and environmental matrices. Results: Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium were the most abundant genera in both indoor dust and nasopharyngeal samples. The analysis indicated lower bacterial diversity in indoor dust samples from flats compared to houses, NEO, ENT, and RCX (p < 0.05). Participants working in the NEO had the highest nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity of all groups (p < 0.05). After 8 h of exposure to the workplace environment, enrichment of the nasopharynx with several new bacterial genera present in the indoor dust was observed in 76% of study participants; however, no significant changes were observed at the level of the nasopharyngeal bacterial diversity (p > 0.05, Shannon index). These “enriching” bacterial genera overlapped between the hospital workplaces – NEO and ENT but differed from those in the research center – RCX. Conclusions: The results suggest that although the composition of nasopharyngeal bacteriome is relatively stable during the day. Short-term exposure to the indoor environment can result in the enrichment of the nasopharynx with bacterial DNA from indoor dust; the bacterial composition, however, varies by the indoor workplace environment.","2023-07","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"202",NA,"1","23",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: konecna2023a PMID: 37525095","konecna2023a ",37525095,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA; Bacteriome; Dust; Exposure; Hospital; Household; Indoor environment; Nasopharynx; Sequencing",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The microbiota of indoor dust on the pre-filter of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which reflect indoor microbial contamination and affect human health, has attracted attention.

By the culture-independent approach of qPCR and high throughput sequencing technologies, our results documented that the cyanobacterial concentrations were highest in autumn, occurred recurrently, and were about 2.60 and 10.57-fold higher than those in winter and summer. We proposed that aquatic and terrestrial cyanobacteria contributed to the pre-filter of HVAC by airborne transportation produced by wave breaks, bubble bursts, and soil surface by wind force, owing to the evidence that cyanobacteria were commonly detected in airborne particulate matters. The cyanobacteria community structure was characterized in Shanghai, where Chroococcidiopsaceae, norank_cyanobacteriales, Nostocaceae, Paraspirulinaceae, and others dominated the dust on the pre-filter of HVAC. Some detected genera, including Nodularia sp., Pseudanabaena sp., and Leptolyngbya sp., potentially produced cyanobacterial toxins, which need further studying to determine their potential threat to human health.

Farm work is associated with various health outcomes, both adverse and beneficial. One mechanism by which farming exposures can impact health is through the microbiome, including the indoor home environment microbiome. It is unknown how individual occupational exposures shape the microbial composition in workers' homes. Objectives: We investigated associations between farm work activities, including specific tasks and pesticide use, and the indoor microbiome in the homes of 468 male farmers. Methods: Participants were licensed pesticide applicators, mostly farmers, enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study from 2008 to 2011. Vacuumed dust from participants' bedrooms underwent whole-genome shotgun sequencing for indoor microbiome assessment. Using questionnaire data, we evaluated 6 farm work tasks (processing of either hay, silage, animal feed, fertilizer, or soy/grains, and cleaning grain bins) and 19 pesticide ingredients currently used in the past year, plus 7 banned persistent pesticide ingredients ever used. Results: All 6 work tasks were associated with increased microbial diversity levels, with a positive dose-response for the total number of tasks performed (P = 0.001). All tasks were associated with altered microbial compositions (weighted UniFrac P = 0.001) and with higher abundance of specific microbes, including soil-based commensal microbes such as Haloterrigena. Among the 19 pesticides, current use of glyphosate and past use of lindane were associated with increased microbial diversity (P = 0.02–0.04). Ten currently used pesticides and all 7 banned pesticides were associated with altered microbial composition (P = 0.001–0.04). Six pesticides were associated with differential abundance of certain microbes. Discussion: Different farm activities and exposures can uniquely impact the dust microbiome inside homes. Our work suggests that changes to the home microbiome could serve as one pathway for how occupational exposures impact the health of workers and their cohabitating family members, offering possible future intervention targets.","2024-02","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"117819",NA,"","243",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: dalton2024a PMID: 38052359","dalton2024a ",38052359,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study identified the association between the time of mold exposure and development of atopic dermatitis and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Method: The association between atopic dermatitis and mold exposure was examined in the Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Diseases birth cohort study (n = 1446). Atopic dermatitis was diagnosed at 1 year of age by pediatric allergists. Exposure to mold was assessed by questionnaire. The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to examine the environmental mycobiome in 20 randomly selected healthy infants and 20 infants with atopic dermatitis at 36 weeks of gestation. Results: Prenatal, but not postnatal, mold exposure was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.83). Levels of total serum IgE at 1 year of age were higher in infants with atopic dermatitis exposed to mold during pregnancy than in healthy infants not exposed to mold during pregnancy (p = 0.021). The relative abundance of uncultured Ascomycota was higher in infants with atopic dermatitis than in healthy infants. The relative abundance of uncultured Ascomycota correlated with total serum IgE levels at 1 year of age (r = 0.613, p < 0.001).

The bacterial and fungal communities present in all dust samples were determined via MiSeq 16S and ITS sequencing, and the concentrations of 27 semi-volatile organic compounds (7 orthophosphates, 6 phthalates, and 14 brominated flame retardants) were determined via GC–MS. Self-report data on the home environment was collected via an online survey of study participants. While the researcher-collected samples (RCS) yielded greater mass than the participant-collected samples (PCS), the alpha and beta diversities of the bacterial and fungal communities recovered in the RCS and PCS were not significantly different, indicating that PCS is a viable option for indoor microbiome studies of residential homes. The microbial communities recovered in both cases reflected the dominance of human-associated bacterial taxa and outdoor-associated fungal taxa with similar pathogen-associated taxa present in each sample type. In both PCS and RCS, the amount of carpet in the home and the frequency of bleach use had a significant effect on the composition of fungal communities. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of potential human health concern, were commonly detected in the homes.

However, low DNA yields have been problematic when employing passive sampling with EDC. To address this challenge, we attempted to increase the efficiency of extraction. We compared DNA extraction efficiency of bacterial components from EDCs captured on filters through filtration using five extraction techniques. By measuring the abundance, diversity and structure of bacterial communities using qPCR and amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes, we found that two techniques outperformed the rest.

The predominant genera showed Acinetobacter > Paracoccus > unidentified Corynebacteriaceae in indoor dusts from university dormitories, whereas Paracoccus > unidentified Cyanobacteria > Acinetobacter in printing shops. The occurrence of Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus suggested the health risks of potential pathogenic bacteria to university students. Significant differences of microbial composition and diversity were proved between university dormitories and printing shops. Chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were dominant bacterial functions, and the seven primary bacterial functions displayed university dormitory > printing shop. BDE 138 and BDE 66 were main environmental parameters affecting the indoor dust bacterial community in university dormitory, while printer and BDE 47 played dominating role in shaping microorganism in printing shop. The complex biotic (potential bacterial pathogens) and abiotic factors (electronic equipment and chemical pollutants) in indoor dusts may pose potential health risks to university students.","2022-01","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"111869",NA,"","203",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: wu2022a PMID: 34411549","wu2022a ",34411549,NA,NA,NA,"Bacterial community; Indoor dust; PBDEs; Printing shop; University dormitory",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the present research, the bioaerosols composition in a small room naturally ventilated was analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Pollen grains were the most abundant particles outdoors while microbial phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were predominant indoors. The main divergences in bioaerosols between indoor and outdoor environments were caused by the different abundance of the biological particles rather than the different taxa composition. Keeping the window open for 2 h did not change significantly the microbial community present indoors, although there was a tendency to mix the components of both environments. The abundance of human-related and potentially harmful microorganisms was higher indoors and was not remarkably affected by natural ventilation. In our study, natural ventilation through window opening had a poor effect on removing these microorganisms from the atmosphere indoor, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as air filtering systems would be required in order to improve the air quality of these environments from a microbiological point of view.","2022-01","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"108438",NA,"","207",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: n2022a","n2022a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Air indoor; Bioaerosols; DNA sequencing; Natural ventilation; Window opening",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is hypothesized that a decrease in the diversity and composition of indoor microbial communities is a sensible explanation for the upsurge in immunoregulatory diseases, with airborne bacteria contributing to this protective effect. However, the composition of this potentially beneficial microbial community in various farm and suburban indoor environments is still to be characterized. We collected settled airborne dust from stables and the associated farmers' homes and from suburban homes using electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) over a period of 14 days. Then, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to assess bacterial abundance. The V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using Ilumina MiSeq in order to assess microbial diversity. The Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2) algorithm was used for the inference of amplicon sequence variants from amplicon data. Airborne bacteria were significantly more abundant in farmers' indoor environments than in suburban homes ( p < 0.001). Cow farmers' homes had significantly higher bacterial diversity than pig farmers' and suburban homes ( p < 0.001). Bacterial taxa, such as Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Lactobacillus were significantly more abundant in farmers' homes than suburban homes, and the same was true for beneficial intestinal bacterial species, such as Lactobacillus amylovorus , Eubacterium hallii , and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii . Furthermore, we found a higher similarity between bacterial communities in individual farmers' homes and their associated cow stables than for pig stables. Our findings contribute with important knowledge on bacterial composition, abundance, and diversity in different environments, which is highly valuable in the discussion on how microbial exposure may contribute to the development of immune-mediated diseases in both children and adults.","2022-06","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"883991",NA,"","13",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: amin2022a","amin2022a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA gene; airborne bacteria; cow; dust; indoor environment; pig",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Considering there is a gap of investigation of dust ARGs, 16 S rRNA gene sequences and high-throughput quantitative PCR were employed to obtain information of microbial communities and accumulated ARGs in dust from different urban places, including the malls, hospitals, schools and parks, to investigate the distribution and influencing factors of ARGs and discover the potential hosts of ARGs in dust. Here, 9 types of ARGs such as sulfonamide, tetracycline, and beta-lactamase and 71 subtypes of ARGs like sul1, tetM-01, and drfA1 were detected in dust. ARGs had varying distribution in different public places and seasons in dust. The abundances of total ARGs, MLSB and tetracycline genes were higher in spring than summer. The diversity of ARGs was highest in malls, follow by hospitals, schools, and parks. Additionally, multi-drug resistance genes in dust were more abundant in hospitals than in schools and parks. The microbes were distinguished as the most important driving factors for ARGs in dust, followed by the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and different places, while dust physicochemical parameters only exert a negligible impact. Notably, several opportunistic pathogens like the Streptococcus, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas were inferred as potential hosts of high-risk ARGs such as mecA, tetM-02, and tetO-01 in dust because of strongly positive co-occurrence.

There have been few reports on the distribution patterns of microbiomes and ARGs in space life support systems. In particular, there have been no detailed investigations of microbiomes and/or antibiotic resistance based on molecular methods in long-term confined bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). Therefore, in the present study, we collected air dust samples from two crew shifts, different areas, and different time points in the ""Lunar Palace 365"" experiment. We evaluated microbial diversity, species composition, functional potential, and antibiotic resistance by combining cultivation-independent analyses (amplicon, shot-gun sequencing, and qPCR). Results: We found that the bacterial community diversity in the Lunar Palace1 (LP1) system was higher than that in a controlled environment but lower than that in an open environment. Personnel exchange led to significant differences in bacterial community diversity, and source tracking analysis revealed that most bacteria in the air derived from the cabin crew and plants, but no differences in microbial function or antibiotic resistance were observed. Thus, human presence had the strongest effect on the succession of microbial diversity in the BLSSs. Conclusions: Our results highlight that microbial diversity in BLSSs is heavily influenced by changes in crew and is unique from other open and controlled environments. Our findings can be used to help develop safe, enclosed BLSS that meet the requirements of human survival and habitation in outer space. In addition, our results can further enhance our understanding of the indoor air microbial community and effectively maintain a safe working and living environment, including plant growth.","2022-01","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"4",NA,"1","17",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: yang2022b","yang2022b",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs); Bioregenerative life support system (BLSS); Lunar Palace 365; Microbiomes",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of this study was to measure how moisture levels, building material type, collection site, and microbial species composition impact microbial growth and emissions of mVOCs. We subjected two common building materials, drywall, and carpet, to treatments with varying moisture availability and measured microbial communities and mVOC emissions. Results: Fungal growth occurred in samples at >75% equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) for carpet with dust and >85% ERH for inoculated painted drywall. In addition to incubated relative humidity level, dust sample collection site (adonis p=0.001) and material type (drywall, carpet, adonis p=0.001) drove fungal and bacterial species composition. Increased relative humidity was associated with decreased microbial species diversity in samples of carpet with dust (adonis p= 0.005). Abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that accounted for >1% emissions were likely released from building materials and the dust itself. However, certain mVOCs were associated with microbial growth from carpet with dust such as C10H16H+ (monoterpenes) and C2H6SH+ (dimethyl sulfide and ethanethiol). CO2 production from samples of carpet with dust at 95% ERH averaged 5.92 mg hr-1 kg-1, while the average for carpet without dust at 95% ERH was 2.55 mg hr-1 kg-1. Conclusion: Microbial growth and mVOC emissions occur at lower relative humidity in carpet and floor dust compared to drywall, which has important implications for human exposure. Even under elevated relative humidity conditions, the VOC emissions profile is dominated by non-microbial VOCs, although potential mVOCs may dominate odor production.

There was no clear geographical distribution pattern in dust-related bacterial communities although a slight but significant (P < 0.05) distance-decay relationship occurred in its community similarity; by contrast, a relatively distinct geographical clustering and a stronger distance-decay relationship were observed in fungal communities at the local scale. The cross-domain (bacteria versus fungi) relationships in the microbiome of the dust samples were mostly observed as robust co-occurrence correlations. The bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, with human skin, soil and plants being potential major sources. The fungal communities largely comprised potential allergens (a median 61% of the fungal sequences), with Alternaria genus within Ascomycota phylum being the most predominant taxa. The profile of dust-related bacterial communities was mainly affected by housing factors related to occupants and houseplants, while that of fungal communities was determined by georeferenced environmental factors, particularly vascular plant diversity. Additionally, a great diversity (1.96 on average for Shannon index) and normalized abundance (2.22 copies per bacterial cell on average) of antibiotic resistance genes were detected across the dust samples, with the dominance of genes resistant to vancomycin and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B. The resistome profile exhibited no distinct geographical pattern, and was primarily driven by certain bacterial phyla and occupancy-related factors.

While the transmission of microorganisms between humans and their local environment is a continuous exchange which generally does not raise cause for alarm, in a hospital setting with immunocompromised patients, these building-source microbial reservoirs may pose a risk. Window glass is often neglected during hospital disinfection protocols, and the microbial communities found there have not previously been examined. This pilot study examined whether living bacterial communities, and specifically the pathogens Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), were present on window components of exterior-facing windows inside patient rooms, and whether relative light exposure (direct or indirect) was associated with changes in bacterial communities on those hospital surfaces. Environmental samples were collected from 30 patient rooms in a single ward at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon, USA. Sampling locations within each room included the window glass surface, both sides of the window curtain, two surfaces of the window frame, and the air return grille. Viable bacterial abundances were quantified using qPCR, and community composition was assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3/V4 region. Viable bacteria occupied all sampled locations, but was not associated with a specific hospital surface or relative sunlight exposure. Bacterial communities were similar between window glass and the rest of the room, but had significantly lower Shannon Diversity, theorized to be related to low nutrient density and resistance to bacterial attachment of glass compared to other surface materials. Rooms with windows that were facing west demonstrated a higher abundance of viable bacteria than those facing other directions, potentially because at the time of sampling (morning) west-facing rooms had not yet been exposed to sunlight that day. Viable C. difficile was not detected and viable MRSA was detected at very low abundance. Bacterial abundance was negatively correlated with distance from the central staff area containing the break room and nursing station. In the present study, it can be assumed that there is more human traffic in the center of the ward, and is likely responsible for the observed gradient of total abundance in rooms along the ward, as healthcare staff both deposit more bacteria during activities and affect microbial transit indoors. Overall, hospital window components possess similar microbial communities to other previously identified room locations known to act as reservoirs for microbial agents of hospital-associated infections.","2020-07","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"e9580",NA,"9580","8",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: horve2020a","horve2020a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA gene; Environmental microbiology; Hospital microbiome; Hospital-associated infections; Indoor microbial community",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As the latest advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the unbiased identification of bacterial communities, we aimed to implement emerging omics technologies to characterize a hospital's microbiome at the center of Cairo, Egypt. To this end, we screened surfaces and inanimate objects in the hospital, focusing on bed sheets and door knobs, with additional screening for resistant microbes and resistance genes. While bacterial load and community composition were not dramatically different between door knobs of hospital units with different hygiene levels, the bacterial communities on door knob samples were richer and more diverse than those detected on bed sheets. Bacteria detected on door knobs were a mix of those associated with dust/particulate matter/debris (e.g., Bacillus, Geobacillus, Aeribacillus) and skin-associated bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium). The latter were among the core genera shared by all analyzed samples. Conversely, bacteria that were more abundant in bed sheets were not associated with a particular source (e.g., Pseudomonas and Nitrobacter). Resistance screening indicated an expansion of a mobile beta-lactamase-encoding gene (blaTEM), reflecting its current global spread. This study is a first step toward more comprehensive screening of hospital surfaces and correlating their microbiome with hospital outbreaks or chronic infections. We conclude that, as hospitals are unique built environments, these findings can inform future infection control strategies in hospitals and health care-related built environments, and attest to the importance of the emerging hospital microbiome research field.","2019-09","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"426–438",NA,"9","23",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: elrakaiby2019a PMID: 31393213","elrakaiby2019a ",31393213,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA; antimicrobial resistance; bioinformatics; built environment; infection control; microbiome; public health",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bioaerosol composition is unique on the International Space Station (ISS), where the size distribution of particles in the air differs from those on Earth. This is due to the lack of gravitational settling and sources of biological particles. However, we do not understand how microbes are influenced by particle size in this environment. We analyzed two types of samples from the ISS: (1) vacuum bag debris which had been sieved into five different size fractions and (2) passively collected particles on a tape substrate with a passive aerosol sampler. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the highest concentration of fungal spores was found in the 106–150 μm-sized sieved dust particles, while the highest concentration of bacterial cells was found in the 150–250 μm-sized sieved dust particles. Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing revealed that particle size was associated with bacterial and fungal communities and statistically significant (p = 0.035, p = 0.036 respectively). Similar fungal and bacterial species were found within the passive aerosol sample and the sieved dust samples. The most abundant fungal species identified in the aerosol and sieved samples are commonly found in food and plant material. Abundant bacterial species were most associated with the oral microbiome and human upper respiratory tract. One limitation to this study was the suboptimal storage conditions of the sieved samples prior to analysis. Overall, our results indicate that microbial exposure in space may depend on particle size. This has implications for ventilation and filtration system design for future space vehicles and habitats.","2019-09","26/04/2024 12:06","26/04/2024 12:06",NA,"7767–7782",NA,"18","103",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: Haines2019","Haines2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A number of bacterial isolates are demonstrated to degrade DEHP in culture, but bacteria may be susceptible to it as well, thus this study examined the relation of DEHP to bacterial communities in dust. Polyvinyl chloride flooring was seeded with homogenized house dust and incubated for up to 14 days, and bacterial communities in dust were identified at days 1, 7, and 14 using the V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. DEHP concentration in dust increased over time, as expected, and bacterial richness and Shannon diversity were negatively correlated with DEHP concentration. Some sequence variants of Bacillus , Corynebacterium jeddahense , Streptococcus , and Peptoniphilus were relatively more abundant at low concentrations of DEHP, while some Sphingomonas , Chryseobacterium , and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family were relatively more abundant at higher concentrations.

Patients often spend several months in the same room, and it has been previously shown that the gut microbiomes of these infants often resemble the microbes found in the NICU. Little is known, however, about the identity, persistence, and absolute abundance of NICU room-associated bacteria over long stretches of time. Here, we couple droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), 16S rRNA gene surveys, and recently published metagenomics data from infant gut samples to infer the extent to which the NICU microbiome is shaped by its room occupants. Results: Over 2832 swabs, wipes, and air samples were collected from 16 private-style NICU rooms housing very low birth weight (< 1500 g), premature (< 31 weeks' gestation) infants. For each infant, room samples were collected daily, Monday through Friday, for 1 month. The first samples from the first infant and the last samples from the last infant were collected 383 days apart. Twenty-two NICU locations spanning room surfaces, hands, electronics, sink basins, and air were collected. Results point to an incredibly simple room community where 5-10 taxa, mostly skin-associated, account for over 50% of the amplicon reads. Biomass estimates reveal four to five orders of magnitude difference between the least to the most dense microbial communities, air, and sink basins, respectively. Biomass trends from bioaerosol samples and petri dish dust collectors suggest occupancy to be a main driver of suspended biological particles within the NICU. Using a machine learning algorithm to classify the origin of room samples, we show that each room has a unique microbial fingerprint. Several important taxa driving this model were dominant gut colonizers of infants housed within each room. Conclusions: Despite regular cleaning of hospital surfaces, bacterial biomass was detectable at varying densities. A room-specific microbiome signature was detected, suggesting microbes seeding NICU surfaces are sourced from reservoirs within the room and that these reservoirs contain actively dividing cells. Collectively, the data suggests that hospitalized infants, in combination with their caregivers, shape the microbiome of NICU rooms.","2018-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"112",NA,"1","6",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: brooks2018a PMID: 29925423","brooks2018a ",29925423,NA,NA,NA,"Built environment; Infant gut; Microbiome; Neonatal intensive care unit",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

High-throughput DNA sequencing of dust samples provides valuable insights into the microbiome present in human-occupied spaces. However, the effect that different sampling methods have on the microbial community recovered from dust samples is not well understood across sample types. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters hold promise as long-term, spatially integrated, high volume samplers to characterize the airborne microbiome in homes and other climate-controlled spaces. In this study, the effect that dust recovery method (i.e., cut and elution, swabbing, or vacuuming) has on the microbial community structure, membership, and repeatability inferred by Illumina sequencing was evaluated. Results: The results indicate that vacuum samples captured higher quantities of total, bacterial, and fungal DNA than swab or cut samples. Repeated swab and vacuum samples collected fromthe same filter were less variable than cut samples with respect to both quantitative DNA recovery and bacterial community structure. Vacuum samples captured substantially greater bacterial diversity than the other methods, whereas fungal diversity was similar across all three methods. Vacuum and swab samples of HVAC filter dust were repeatable and generally superior to cut samples. Nevertheless, the contribution of environmental and human sources to the bacterial and fungal communities recovered via each sampling method was generally consistent across the methods investigated. Conclusions: Dust recovery methodologies have been shown to affect the recovery, repeatability, structure, and membership of microbial communities recovered from dust samples in the built environment. The results of this study are directly applicable to indoor microbiota studies utilizing the filter forensics approach. More broadly, this study provides a better understanding of the microbial community variability attributable to sampling methodology and helps inform interpretation of data collected from other types of dust samples collected from indoor environments.","2018-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"22",NA,"1","6",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: maestre2018a PMID: 29382378","maestre2018a ",29382378,NA,NA,NA,"Bacteria; Built environment; Filter forensics; Fungi; HVAC; Indoor microbiology",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the standard samples of 11 species of yeasts and molds allowed us to validate the Operational taxonomic units (OTU) assignment. These calibrated samples also showed a low amplification bias, a low rate of sequencing errors and the semi-quantitative nature of the technique.

In this study, an in vitro experiment was conducted to demonstrate changes in the culturable house dust-borne bacterial compositions and diversities by exposures to three biocides of CuSO4 (CUS), triclosan (TRC), or benzalkonium chloride with respective concentrations of 90, 45, and 0.1 𝜇g ml−1. The high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial compositions and diversities. The α diversity analysis showed reductions in the species richness and evenness by exposures to CUS and TRC (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank tests). The β diversity analysis revealed the significant changes in the community memberships for CUS and TRC (p < 0.05, P-tests based on the Jaccard indices), which were thought due to selective bacterial inhibitions. The taxonomic analysis found the inhibitions of Enterococcus, Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia,Clostridium sensu stricto, and Stenotrophomonas. The findings of the present in vitro study provide important insights into how use of biocides in indoor environments affects bacterial compositions and diversities. Future in situ research is warranted to confirm how they impact indoor microbial compositions and diversities, which are thought to be important for human health.","2016-07","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"1133–1146",NA,"5","22",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: xu2016a","xu2016a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16S rDNA; benzalkonium chloride; copper (II) sulfate; high-throughput sequencing; next-generation sequencing; triclosan",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Microbes experience selective pressures such as microgravity, desiccation, poor nutrient-availability due to cleaning, and an increased radiation level. We hypothesized that the microbial community inside the ISS is modified by adapting to these stresses. For this reason, we analyzed 8–12 years old dust samples from Russian ISS modules with major focus on the long-time surviving portion of the microbial community. We consequently assessed the cultivable microbiota of these samples in order to analyze their extremotolerant potential against desiccation, heat-shock, and clinically relevant antibiotics. In addition, we studied the bacterial and archaeal communities from the stored Russian dust samples via molecular methods (next-generation sequencing, NGS) and compared our new data with previously derived information from the US American ISS dust microbiome. Results: We cultivated and identified in total 85 bacterial, non-pathogenic isolates (17 different species) and 1 fungal isolate from the 8–12 year old dust samples collected in the Russian segment of the ISS. Most of these isolates exhibited robust resistance against heat-shock and clinically relevant antibiotics. Microbial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene targeting Next Generation Sequencing showed signatures of human-associated microorganisms (Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Coprococcus etc.), but also specifically adapted extremotolerant microorganisms. Besides bacteria, the detection of archaeal signatures in higher abundance was striking. Conclusions: Our findings reveal (i) the occurrence of living, hardy microorganisms in archived Russian ISS dust samples, (ii) a profound resistance capacity of ISS microorganisms against environmental stresses, and (iii) the presence of archaeal signatures on board. In addition, we found indications that the microbial community in the Russian segment dust samples was different to recently reported US American ISS microbiota.","2016-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"65",NA,"1","4",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: mora2016a PMID: 27998314","mora2016a ",27998314,NA,NA,NA,"Archaea; Confined habitat; Extremotolerant; International Space Station; Microbiome",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Understanding the composition of the ISS microbial community will facilitate further development of safety and maintenance practices. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. RESULTS: Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.","2015-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"50",NA,"1","3",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: checinska2015a PMID: 26502721","checinska2015a ",26502721,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to determine whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the sampler type, we compared different passive, settled dust sampling approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota. RESULTS: Settled dust sampling approaches-utilizing plastic petri dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs)-were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a sampling environment regardless of the sampler type. The sampling environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community composition within a study, while sampler type was found to have much less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with EDCs and TefTex. The highest correlations between duplicate samples were observed for EDC and petri dish approaches, indicating greater experimental repeatability for these sampler types. For the EDC samples, it became apparent that, due to the fibrous nature of the material, a rigorous extraction protocol is crucial to obtain optimal yields and stable, repeatable results. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between sampler types were strong both in compositional and quantitative terms, and thus, the particular choice of passive settled dust sampler is not likely to strongly alter the overall conclusion of a study that aims to characterize dust across different environments. Microbial cell abundances determined from settled dust varied with the use of different sampling approaches, and thus, consistency in the method is necessary to allow for absolute comparisons within and among studies. Considering practical aspects, petri dishes were found to be an inexpensive, simple, and feasible approach that showed the highest quantitative determinations under typical building conditions, though the choice of sampler will ultimately depend on study logistics and characteristics such as low- or high-exposure settings.","2015-12","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"46",NA,"1","3",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: adams2015a PMID: 26434807","adams2015a ",26434807,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this paper is to gain knowledge on the bacterial and fungal communities in dust causing organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) and in reference dust not causing ODTS. Bacterial and fungal communities were described in personal exposure samples from grass seed workers developing ODTS, in dust generated from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust generated from reference seeds not causing ODTS. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region, as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) were used for identification of fungi and bacteria in personal exposure samples and in dust samples from grass seeds causing ODTS and in dust from reference grass seeds. Furthermore, activities of enzymes were measured in the same samples.The sequencing data revealed more than 150 bacterial and 25 fungal genera present in each sample. Streptomyces spp., Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus microsporus were dominating in the dust causing ODTS but not in the reference dust. The dustiness in terms of Mucor sp. and R. microsporus were 100-1000 times higher for problematic seeds compared to reference seeds. The bacterial species in the dust causing ODTS included pathogenic species such as Klebsiella pneumonia and Streptomyces pneumonia, and it contained increased concentrations of total protein, serine protease, chitinase, and β-glucosidase. Twenty-three bacterial genera covered more than 50% of the total reads in the personal and problematic seed dust. These 23 genera accounted for less than 7% of the total reads in the reference seed dust. The microbial community of the dust from the problematic seeds showed great similarities to that from the personal air samples from the workers. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time a shift in the microbial community in aerosol samples that caused ODTS compared to the reference samples that did not cause the ODTS. Furthermore, elevated enzyme activities were found in the dust causing ODTS.","2015-07","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"255–267",NA,"","140",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: madsen2015a PMID: 25880607","madsen2015a ",25880607,NA,NA,NA,"Bioaerosols; Exposure; Microbial diversity; ODTS; Working environment",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Characterizing the indoor microbial community present in the built environment is challenging and complicated by the vast array of biological methods available to building professionals. Furthermore, the particular biological technique employed to study an indoor environment can have a significant impact on the results obtained. This study evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of four biological methods suitable for indoor microbial investigations: culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Sanger sequencing, and pyrosequencing. The results obtained from a study of four buildings are used to evaluate the merits of each bioanalytical approach. In each of the four study sites, the microbial-laden dust recovered on HVAC filters was used to provide a passive, long-term sample of the indoor air. Culturing of the microorganisms recovered from the dust was the least expensive method tested but provided a limited characterization of the microbial community present. qPCR provided the most specific information about the presence and quantity of target microorganisms but this method requires a priori knowledge of the species of interest and specifically designed primers that may not enumerate unanticipated species. Sanger sequencing provided microbial identification at the species level but lacked coverage to fully describe the microbial community present. Pyrosequencing provided in-depth sequence coverage of the microbial community present (to the genus level) but the vast dataset generated required increased computational analysis and data storage. Nevertheless, pyrosequencing when coupled with qPCR for target species quantification represents a viable approach that should become more accessible to building professionals as user-friendly software for analyzing sequencing results becomes available and more commercial laboratories offer these services. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2014-01","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"167–175",NA,"1","20",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: hoisington2014b","hoisington2014b",NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fungal signal in settled dust of five university teaching laboratory classrooms, one of which was used for a mycology course, was surveyed. The fungal richness and composition in the dust of the nonmycology classrooms were remarkably similar to each other, while the mycology classroom was dominated by abundantly sporulating specimen fungi, particularly puffballs, and appeared to have a lower overall richness based on rarefaction curves and richness estimators. The fungal biomass was three to five times higher in the mycology classroom than the other classrooms, indicating that fungi added to the mycology classroom swamped the background fungi present in indoor air. Thus, the high abundance of a few taxa can skew the perception of richness and composition when samples are sequenced to an even depth. Next, we used in silico manipulations of the observed data to confirm that a unique signature can be identified with HTS approaches when the source is abundant, whether or not the taxon identity is distinct. Lastly, aerobiology of indoor fungi is discussed. © 2013 The Author(s).","2013-11","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"735–741",NA,"4","66",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: adams2013b PMID: 23880792","adams2013b ",23880792,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It remains unclear whether certain bacteria account for the protective effect. Methods The high variability of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene allows assessing diversity and specificity of bacterial communities by single-strand configuration polymorphism (SSCP). DNA was extracted from mattress dust samples of 489 school-age children from rural and suburban regions in Germany. A fragment of the bacteria-specific 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR, digested to single-strand DNA, and subjected to electrophoresis. The resulting band patterns reflect the underlying DNA sequences. The individual bands were tested for associations with asthma, hay fever, and atopy in quantitative and qualitative multivariable analyses. Significantly associated bands were isolated and sequenced. The sequences were compared to a database, and distinct bacteria were identified. Results Seven of 76 independent bands were found to be inversely associated with asthma, atopic sensitization, and hay fever with odds ratios ranging from 0.17 to 0.73. The bands contained the sequences of Acinetobacter sp., Lactobacillus spp., Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus sciuri, Jeotgalicoccus sp., Corynebacterium spp., and others.

However, the census of microorganisms in the indoor environment is limited by the use of selective, culture-based detection techniques. By using clone library sequencing of full-length internal transcribed spacer region combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 69 fungal species or assay groups and cultivation, we have been able to generate a more comprehensive description of the total indoor mycoflora. Using this suite of methods, we assessed the impact of moisture damage on the fungal community composition of settled dust and building material samples (n = 8 and 16, correspondingly). Water-damaged buildings (n = 2) were examined pre- and post- remediation, and compared with undamaged reference buildings (n = 2). Results: Culture-dependent and independent methods were consistent in the dominant fungal taxa in dust, but sequencing revealed a five to ten times higher diversity at the genus level than culture or qPCR. Previously unknown, verified fungal phylotypes were detected in dust, accounting for 12% of all diversity. Fungal diversity, especially within classes Dothideomycetes and Agaricomycetes tended to be higher in the water damaged buildings. Fungal phylotypes detected in building materials were present in dust samples, but their proportion of total fungi was similar for damaged and reference buildings. The quantitative correlation between clone library phylotype frequencies and qPCR counts was moderate (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). Conclusions: We examined a small number of target buildings and found indications of elevated fungal diversity associated with water damage. Some of the fungi in dust were attributable to building growth, but more information on the material-associated communities is needed in order to understand the dynamics of microbial communities between building structures and dust. The sequencing-based method proved indispensable for describing the true fungal diversity in indoor environments. However, making conclusions concerning the effect of building conditions on building mycobiota using this methodology was complicated by the wide natural diversity in the dust samples, the incomplete knowledge of material-associated fungi fungi and the semiquantitative nature of sequencing based methods. © 2011 Pitkäranta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2011","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"235",NA,"1","11",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: pitkaeranta2011a PMID: 22017920","pitkaeranta2011a ",22017920,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In previous studies, markers of microbial exposure have been inversely related to these conditions. Methods: In two cross-sectional studies, we compared children living on farms with those in a reference group with respect to the prevalence of asthma and atopy and to the diversity of microbial exposure. In one study - PARSIFAL (Prevention of Allergy - Risk Factors for Sensitization in Children Related to Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle) - samples of mattress dust were screened for bacterial DNA with the use of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses to detect environmental bacteria that cannot be measured by means of culture techniques. In the other study - GABRIELA (Multidisciplinary Study to Identify the Genetic and Environmental Causes of Asthma in the European Community [GABRIEL] Advanced Study) - samples of settled dust from children's rooms were evaluated for bacterial and fungal taxa with the use of culture techniques. Results: In both studies, children who lived on farms had lower prevalences of asthma and atopy and were exposed to a greater variety of environmental microorganisms than the children in the reference group. In turn, diversity of microbial exposure was inversely related to the risk of asthma (odds ratio for PARSIFAL, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.89; odds ratio for GABRIELA, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99). In addition, the presence of certain more circumscribed exposures was also inversely related to the risk of asthma; this included exposure to species in the fungal taxon eurotium (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.76) and to a variety of bacterial species, including Listeria monocytogenes, bacillus species, corynebacterium species, and others (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86). Conclusions: Children living on farms were exposed to a wider range of microbes than were children in the reference group, and this exposure explains a substantial fraction of the inverse relation between asthma and growing up on a farm.

Recent studies that used culture-independent sampling methods demonstrated a high diversity of indoor fungi distinct from that of outdoor environments. Others have shown temporal fluctuations of fungal assemblages in human environments and modest correlations with human activity, but global-scale patterns have not been examined, despite the manifest significance of biogeography in other microbial systems. Here we present a global survey of fungi from indoor environments ( n = 72), using both taxonomic and phylogeny-informative molecular markers to determine whether global or local indoor factors determine indoor fungal composition. Contrary to common ecological patterns, we show that fungal diversity is significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics, with distance from the equator being the best predictor of phylogenetic community similarity. Fungal composition is significantly auto-correlated at the national and hemispheric spatial scales. Remarkably, building function has no significant effect on indoor fungal composition, despite stark contrasts between architecture and materials of some buildings in close proximity. Distribution of individual taxa is significantly range- and latitude-limited compared with a null model of randomized distribution.

We spend most of our lives in indoor environments and are exposed to microbes present in these environments. Hence, knowledge about this exposure is important for understanding how it impacts on human health. However, the bacterial flora in indoor environments has been only fragmentarily explored and mostly using culture methods. The application of molecular methods previously utilised in other environments has resulted in a substantial increase in our awareness of microbial diversity. Results. The composition and dynamics of indoor dust bacterial flora were investigated in two buildings over a period of one year. Four samples were taken in each building, corresponding to the four seasons, and 16S rDNA libraries were constructed. A total of 893 clones were analysed and 283 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected among them using 97% sequence similarity as the criterion. All libraries were dominated by Gram-positive sequences, with the most abundant phylum being Firmicutes. Four OTUs having high similarity to Corynebacterium-, Propionibacterium-, Streptococcus- and Staphylococcus- sequences were present in all samples. The most abundant of the Gram-negative OTUs were members of the family Sphingomonadaceae, followed by Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Neisseriaceae and Rhizobiaceae. The relative abundance of alpha- and betaproteobacteria increased slightly towards summer at the expense of firmicutes. The proportion of firmicutes and gammaproteobacteria of the total diversity was highest in winter and that of actinobacteria, alpha- and betaproteobacteria in spring or summer, whereas the diversity of bacteroidetes peaked in fall. A statistical comparison of the libraries revealed that the bacterial flora of the two buildings differed during all seasons except spring, but differences between seasons within one building were not that clear, indicating that differences between the buildings were greater than the differences between seasons. Conclusion. This work demonstrated that the bacterial flora of indoor dust is complex and dominated by Gram-positive species. The dominant phylotypes most probably originated from users of the building. Seasonal variation was observed as proportional changes of the phyla and at the species level. The microflora of the two buildings investigated differed statistically and differences between the buildings were more pronounced than differences between seasons. © 2008 Rintala et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","2008","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"56",NA,"1","8",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: rintala2008a PMID: 18397514","rintala2008a ",18397514,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In spite of this, air is an important transfer medium for bacteria, with the bacteria in indoor air having potentially major consequences for the health of a building's occupants. A major example is the decreased diversity and altered composition of indoor airborne microbial communities as a proposed explanation for the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies worldwide. Previous research has shown that living on a farm confers protection against development of asthma and allergies, with airborne bacteria suggested as playing a role in this protective effect. However, the composition of this beneficial microbial community has still not been identified. We sampled settled airborne dust using a passive dust sampler from Danish pig stables, associated farmers' homes, and from suburban homes (267 samples in total) and carried out quantitative PCR measurements of bacterial abundance and MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes found in these samples. Airborne bacteria had a greater diversity and were significantly more abundant in pig stables and farmers' homes than suburban homes (Wilcoxon rank sum test P < 0.05). Moreover, bacterial taxa previously suggested to contribute to a protective effect had significantly higher relative and absolute abundance in pig stables and farmers' homes than in suburban homes (ALDEx2 with P < 0.05), including Firmicutes, Peptostreptococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Ruminiclostridium, and Lactobacillus. Pig stables had significantly lower airborne bacterial diversity than farmers' homes, and there was no discernable direct transfer of airborne bacteria from stable to home. This study identifies differences in indoor airborne bacterial communities that may be an important component of this putative protective effect, while showing that pig stables themselves do not appear to directly contribute to the airborne bacterial communities in the homes of farmers. These findings improve our understanding of the role of airborne bacteria in the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergy.","2018-05","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"870",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: vestergaard2018a PMID: 29765370","vestergaard2018a ",29765370,NA,NA,NA,"16S rRNA gene; Airborne bacteria; Bacteria; Built environment; Microbiome; Pig stables",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The cultured bacterial counts were more in the ISS samples than cultured fungal population. The rapid molecular analyses targeted to estimate viable population exhibited 5-fold increase in bacterial (qPCR-PMA assay) and 25-fold increase in microbial (adenosine triphosphate assay) burden than the cultured bacterial population. The ribosomal nucleic acid-based identification of cultivated strains revealed the presence of only four to eight bacterial species in the ISS samples, however, the viable bacterial diversity detected by the PMA-pyrosequencing method was far more diverse (12 to 23 bacterial taxa) with the majority consisting of members of actinobacterial genera (Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium) and Staphylococcus.

Whilst many of these microbes are benign, some are beneficial, some harmful, yet our knowledge of the spatial heterogeneity of bacterial assemblages in our residential environment remains limited. To investigate the existence of a common core house dust bacterial microbiome we selected household vacuum dusts, collected through a citizen science approach, from homes across two bioclimatic regions (UK, Oceanic/Maritime and Greece, Mediterranean). Following the extraction of DNA from each dust sample, we targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina NextSeq sequencing. PERMANOVA analysis of the microbial communities at family level grouped samples within their distinct bioclimatic region and SIMPER analysis at genus level identified the statistically significant taxa responsible for driving diversity between these groups. A “common to all” core house dust microbiome consisted of Acinetobacter , Massalia, Rubellimicrobium, Sphingomonas and Staphylococcus ; genera typically associated with human occupancy and common environmental sources. Additionally, a “unique location specific” microbiome was identified, reflective of the bioclimatic region. The Greek dusts indicated a lower average diversity than the UK house dusts, with a high abundance of Rhizobiaceae in the Greek samples. Our study highlights citizen science as a powerful approach to access the indoor residential environment, at scale, and establishes the existence of a “core” house dust microbiome independent of bioclimatic region.","2021-11","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"754657",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: thompson2021a","thompson2021a",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16S; bacterial assemblage; citizen science; microbiome; vacuum dust",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite their ubiquity and abundance, we have a limited understanding of the microbial diversity found within homes and how the composition and diversity of microbial communities change across different locations within the home. Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes. Together this work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the microbial communities found in the home and the factors that shape the structure of these communities both within and between homes. © 2013 Dunn et al.","2013-05","25/04/2024 16:33","25/04/2024 16:33",NA,"e64133",NA,"5","8",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Citation Key: dunn2013a PMID: 23717552","dunn2013a ",23717552,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,"Bertilsson, Stefan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
